		<meta property="og:description" content="Æstella was born to the Harpy known as "Xæra Dhyleo Lambdadelta", the Chief of Staff of the Revolutionary Army. Like her mother before her; she also shortens her own Middle name down to the "D." moniker hated around the world by most people. Æstella was originally born as a half-harpy, half-lunarian hybrid, but after her mother eradicated the Harpy Pirates that was started by her thirty-fifth great-granddaughter's Captain and Queen, Xæra personally went out of the way that Æstella's father's Lunarian DNA would show over her own Harpy DNA. As a result of the surgery that left Æstella a miracle in her own right; she has left nothing of her mother's relationship except for her left eye's reddish hue, last name, and being a part of the Revolutionary Army. The resulting surgery caused Æstella resentment towards Xæra for seeking out a cure for her and instead of seeking her mother's weathermancy skill out; she gravitated towards her father's pyrokinetic abilities and for Æstella to learn in great detail about her father's intense strength and durability associated with the Lunarian flame. By the time Æstella turned seven years old, the Revolutionary Army would have been really up in motion with their plans, but as time went on, she was never allowed to join the army due to her young age at the time. Due to the sorrow caused by her own family denying her entry into the army, she would seek out another solution to aid in the Revolutionary Army's cause, even if they would deem it fruitless." />

					<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;">Æstella was born to the Harpy known as "Xæra Dhyleo Lambdadelta", the Commander of the Grand Division of the Revolutionary Army. Like her mother before her; she also shortens her own Middle name down to the "D." moniker hated around the world by most people. Æstella was originally born as a half-harpy, half-lunarian hybrid, but after her mother eradicated the Harpy Pirates that was started by her thirty-fifth great-granddaughter's Captain and Queen, Xæra personally went out of the way that Æstella's father's Lunarian DNA would show over her own Harpy DNA. As a result of the surgery that left Æstella a miracle in her own right; she has left nothing of her mother's relationship except for her left eye's reddish hue, last name, and being a part of the Revolutionary Army. The resulting surgery caused Æstella resentment towards Xæra for seeking out a cure for her and instead of seeking her mother's weathermancy skill out; she gravitated towards her father's pyrokinetic abilities and for Æstella to learn in great detail about her father's intense strength and durability associated with the Lunarian flame. By the time Æstella turned seven years old, the Revolutionary Army would have been really up in motion with their plans, but as time went on, she was never allowed to join the army due to her young age at the time. Due to the sorrow caused by her own family denying her entry into the army, she would seek out another solution to aid in the Revolutionary Army's cause, even if they would deem it fruitless.</div>
					<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;">Æstella would get better at her singing as time went on and would eventually hold concerts of her own. Due to her singing voice occasionally producing a flame-breath by accident, her family eventually got her a special pair of headphones made out of seaprism stone that would nullify a future devil fruit she may acquire in the future, but also to restrain her Lunarian fire without her will so she would not burn those around her by accident. As time passed, she would eventually become more intune with herself as well as the rest of the Revolutionary Army that her parents were the leaders of. Æstella would often times sing for the Revolutionaries on Momoiro Island after any losses they would ensue from the World Government or their raids of freedom on neighboring islands. The songstress would not be the best idol around, but she would be well enough to keep the mood of those around her in good spirits with her invigorating songs. As she got older, she would eventually join the North Division of the Revolutionary Army properly, albeit against her parent's wises who were at the head of the Revolutionary Army.</div>
					<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;">After joining the Revolutionary Army proper, Æstella  has been granted more freedom than before she joined since her parent's could not risk her actually leaking data and intel if she was ever captured or got off the island. With given as much freedom as a new recruit to the Revolutionaries, she would actually be happy and would wonder if this is the feeling her songs gave to others around her. With time advancing forward in full suit, Æstella would learn how to suppress her emotions while not singing one of her songs in order to keep intel from leaking when she is in danger. From then on, she typically spent her time sparing with her father for a deeper understanding of her Lunarian DNA and what it means for her to better help her familiar ties to the Revolutionary Army while not writing new songs or singing for others. She would have yet to go on a proper mission yet and is looking forward to helping the people of Alabasta with her music.</div>

				<h2>Lunarian Singer</h2>
				<div><strong>History:</strong> Æstella takes more liking to her Lunarian DNA than her mother's Harpy DNA after her family had her surgicaly modified to resemble her father's Lunarian traits. While Æstella partialy resents this, she is understanding of the notion enough. Being trained by both of her parents who are both high ranking officiers in the Revolutionary Army, she has a well understanding of what her Lunarian DNA grants her and how to control her weakness.</div>
				<div><strong>Internal Flame:</strong> Being lectured what the flame on her back means, Æstella knows what determins wheather the flame that makes her invincible active or not is present. Æstella can form fire balls and launch them at will. Her Lunarian flame only manifests while she is using flame based attacks.</div>
				<div style="color: #BB86FC;">▰▱▱▱</div>
				<div><strong>Flamed Melee:</strong> Once trained in control, Æstella can ignite any item she holds onto. In doing so, she can burn people she fights. At this stage, her own durability is reduced to ash while igniting weaponry.</div>
				<div style="color: #BB86FC;">▰▰▱▱</div>
				<div><strong>Flame Shot:</strong> While Æstella's flame is out, she can double her agility and perception at the cost of her durability. She also can keep projectiles lit aflame that she launches as well as burn those that listen to her music if she so pleased. She wears a headset made of sea-prism stone during her concerts for this very reason.</div>
				<div style="color: #BB86FC;">▰▰▰▱</div>
				<div><strong>Eternal Flame:</strong> At this level, Æstella's Flame only goes out while she is asleep, or using her Devil Fruit abilities.</div>
