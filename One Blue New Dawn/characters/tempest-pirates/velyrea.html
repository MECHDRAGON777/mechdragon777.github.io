				<h1 id="Backstory">[ Backstory ]</h1>
					<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;">Velyrea was born to the Celestial Dragon Family of "Celeste" under the name of "Yesenia Celeste" on February 29th in the year of 1088. Her mother went through an experimental surgery as a punishment for leaving Marījoa for a seemingly random Sky Island in the Calm Belt; however, they left so that their currently unborn can grown up in a safer environment. Unbeknownst to her parents however, the Sky Island in question that Yesenia's Parents went to happens to be borderline Impel Down territory. The island's inhabitants were known for working for the World Government on occasion and was quickly able to identify the Celestes as Celestial Dragons and as a result, were branded as "Fallens".</div>
					<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;">After being recognized by the citizens of the island, they ended up taking the soon-to-be-mother to the island's science team for medical torture and experimentation. When they found that she was pregnant with Yesenia, they turned the freakish experiments towards the Human Lineage Factor in hopes to get some sort of weapon of out of the child. Due to recent uproars of how genetic modifications granted one of the high ranking members her strength, the doctor used the chance to try to replicate her genetics to have the child to either be a weapon for the World Government or to study her for a weakness the Revolutionary Officer. Though a freak medical miracle, Yesenia was born with wings, tail feathers, and elongated bird legs with sharp talons.</div>
					<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;">Through her infancy and early childhood, the girl was supplemented to surgical torture and attempted dismemberment on multiple occasions. While her bones were hollow, they were tougher than normal and would lead her to keeping her wings; however, the scars and pain would have been amplified due to how deep the cuts where. Due to the sheer difficulty to cut through the lass's wings, Yesenia was seen as a "Demon of the Sky". When she was old enough to speak, she was transferred to "Crimson Hell" of Impel Down for living. She ended up having to endure the Kenju (bladed tree) and Haribarisō (needle grass) just like the all of the 𝕭15,000,000 and lower bounty prisoners. The Haribarisō never was able to pierce her Harpy Feet in the first place, but the Kenju dug into her skin to the point where she was always dripping with her own blood.</div>
					<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;">By the time Yesenia turned five, most people would have forgotten her name with the exception of a few Celestial Dragons and would start being called "Prisoner 02291088" as her name was never told to those that took her from her parents in the first place. Anytime she was to be tested on for progress of her growth and for the World Government to look for weaknesses; they would take her down to "Freezing Hell" of Impel Down, the place home to the prisoners with a bounty exceeding 𝕭100,000,000. While it would be noticed that she did not do well in the extreme heat of "Blazing Hell" nor the extreme cold of "Freezing Hell"; she would often be kept in "Freezing Hell" for testing and in "Crimson Hell" when not being experimented on.</div>
					<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;">When Yesenia turned ten, she would have picked up on the notion that 02291088 was the "name" she was given and have stopped feeling pain from all of the Kenju. Around this time, she would have seen multiple officers, Marines, and Guards dispatch of prisoners that attempted to escape or misbehave. One of the most common ways she would notice would be by the Marines stabbing prisoners with their fingers and by Kicking gusts of wind at other prisoners. She would not think much about it, but this is where she would take note of how to defend herself. She would sometimes hear the Marines call out "Tempest Kick" or "Finger Pistol" on occasion, but often time, she would keep herself in the corner of her cell in fear and shyness.</div>
					<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;">Due to the nature of her genetic modifications, clothing became an issue as she got older as she was the youngest person to be classified as a prisoner of Impel Down, so they often did not have the best of prison uniforms for her. They usually were tailor made for her every three or so years when they got torn to shreds by the Kenju in Crimson Hell. With her body being covered in lacerations from head to tail, it would become increasingly difficult for for the guards to keep up with her uniform as she got older due to her being able to endure the Kenju more and more through the years. When she turned fifteen, she stopped feeling the pain from all of the lacerations from Crimson Hell and would fall asleep on the Haribarisō not caring about the pain that was at that point, nonexistent. After she started falling asleep on the Haribarisō, the Guards started to move her further and further down in levels of Impel Down. The ultimate torture for Yesenia would be Starvation Hell. Never getting much food in the first place, she was always hungry; the heat from Blazing Hell just amplified her Demonic hunger even more.</div>
					<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;">Yesenia would be eventually be taken off the prison island of Impel Down on multiple outings to one of the top scientists who would have more adequate tools at their disposal. This would be the first time the Fallen Celestial would find out that the loneliness she has suffered possibly could have a potential end as well as eventually acquiring the knowledge required to have potential to learn of her ancestry. Guards would have spoken about the harpy girl's Celestial heritage due to calling her "The Experiment of the Heavens" and "Experiment of the Celestials" on multiple occasions. As a result of all of her tortured suffering, Yesenia Celeste would be driven to get out of this nightmarish place. For five years of tortured experimentation on her anatomical makeup, she would learn of the patterns and regulations the guards took days on end.</div>
					<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;">Skip forward to February 29th of year 1111; She would have escaped Impel Down increasing her bounty by a whopping 𝕭120,000,000 for being a Fallen escapee of Impel Down. The poor harpy would have no knowledge of this bounty increase or what a bounty even was. For the rest of the Winter, she would be flying from Island to Island looking for food to keep her alive. Her elegant blond hair could be classified as a ruined mane with how filthy it was. Due to all of the mistreatment and pain she was forced to suffer as a result of being a prisoner of unfortunate fate and timing of her birth and the circumstances surrounding it. With the Winds of fate at her back and her, quite filthy hair, flowing in the wind, she would mainly use her wings to glide across the oceanic voyage; mainly due to the lack of wind in the Calm Belt. Yesenia Celeste enjoyed the brief moment of freedom until she realized that starvation was quite a serious endeavor that she would have to overcome one way or another.</div>
					<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;">More often than naught, she would end up in forested islands that lacked a lot of easily accessible food for the harpy who would then be forced to learn how to kill for food. As a result of facts of this caliber, she would resort to kicking and stabbing the wild beasts of the multitude of islands visited by her. It would take her a few months, but she would get efficient enough to actually cause damage with her Mock Feather Pistol and Mock Tempest Kick. She would usually devour the putrid trash that swam in the vicinity of the island till she had the strength necessary to demolish the beasts of the island for food. After about a month or two of the true isolation, she decided to venture outside of the island she landed on which lead her towards the restaurant known as the Baratie.</div>
