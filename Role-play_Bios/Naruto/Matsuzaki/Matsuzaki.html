				<h1 id="Backstory">[ Backstory ]</h1>
					<h2><u>Pre-Academy</u></h2>
					<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;">Due to her Clan's history, the Chinoike were exhiled from Kumogakure into the Valley of Hell in the Steam Village. Due to the exhile of her clan, Matsuzaki begins to hate the Uchiha for being responsible for the incident. The life of those in the Valley were often harsh and cruel and as a result of the cruelty, leaving the Valley was often saut upon. Due to being of age to enroll at a Ninja Academy, she had the chance to go to another village to learn suggested she could get there.</div>
					<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;">The closest village to her new home would be The Village hidden in the Clouds where her family was recently exhiled from. Due to the Ketsuryūgan being the reason of the exhile in the first place, she was instructed to abstain from using it if possible and if she had to, make sure she had a way to hide her eyes while using it. The young lass would end up heading to the village head for the Steam Village to get an Academy Transfer to the Cloud Village in order to train to be a strong Kunoichi. After getting approved, she would set out to track across the wilderness that is Yukigakure, the Village hidden in the Snow.</div>
					<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;">Matsuzaki was not that skilled in the art of Bukijutsu or Kenjutsu before trecking through the snowy wilderness, but did know how to use her Ketsuryūgan to make weapons out of blood and she carried a small sword sheeth with her that was passed through her family to carry the iron water of the Valley of Hell. Most of her training in Kenjutsu came from her use of a Blood Katana she often made to slay any wild animals that got close to her so she could have somthing to eat.</div>
					<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;">Over the year it took her to get to the Cloud Village, she would have learned just enough Kenjutsu to hold her own against wild beasts, but would still have issues against those who knew how to actually use a sword. During the same time, she would also learn a bit of Taijutsu to quickly knock out the beasts when she did not need food using her Ketsuryūgan's genjutsu. Being of the infamous Chinoike Clan, she would learn to appreciate her Genjutsu prowess.</div>
					<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;">Eventually, Matsuzaki would end up crossing the boarder of the Village hidden in the Clouds at the age of 11. She was just a child ventureing out at the age of 10. When she got to the village, she was instructed to give her identification papers and reasoning for why she was showing up in the Hidden Village. Her documents showed her Ninja ID was Yu-00460229 and that she would be a Kunoichi to be inrolled in a Cloud Village Academy. The papers specificaly listed her name as "Matsuzaki of the Steam" omitting her last name and clan name due to the Chinoike past. The village staff would be reluctant to allow a Steam Village girl into the Cloud village so soon after the Chinoike clan was exhiled from the Cloud Village to the Steam Village without a last name on the paperwor, but would eventually let her in.</div>
					<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;">After getting into the Village officialy, she would be instructed to head straight to a village infirmary to help her with all of the wounds she aquired from the voyage to the Cloud Village. The creepiest part of her was that while she had a fair bit of blood loss from the wild beasts she had to kill for food, she actually carried the blood she lost with her. While it could not be used in a transfusion, it would be easy to tell that her blood type was AB+ from all of the blood she had on her.</div>
					<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;">With about a week in the infirmary, she would be released in just enough time to enroll in the Academy. Matsuzaki would be one of the youngest students enrolling, but would work towards the goal of being able to be a ninja regardless. On her arrival to class on the first day, she handed over a package to the instructor which contained a note about even more detail about the girl who was now in the class and a Steam Village Headband. She would be allowed to wear the Steam Headband after graduating suggested she also wore clotheing of the Cloud Village while in the Cloud Village and would be instructed to stay in the Cloud Village until she either turned eighteen or reached the rank of Jōnin.</div>
					<h2><u>Academy</u></h2>
					<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;">While at the Academy, Matsuzaki would do quite well in her studies to become a Kunoichi; however would strugle with the Ninjutsu aspect of the examinations and classes. A weird notion about her is that she seemed to only be able to use Jutsu that did not matter the nature of Chakra used or specificaly used Yin Chakra. The Chakra nature often associated with Genjutsu. This would mostly fly under the radar; however, would be noted on her info that would be passed to her Squad Captain later on. As her days went on, she would often spar with the other students after class who agreed. She would use one of the training katanas from the school for Kenjutsu spars or her fists and feet for taijutsu sparing. She never actually used Genjutsu in her sparing sessions at the Academy with students.</div>
					<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;">By the time Genjutsu was taught to the class, Matsuzaki would excell due to her clan lineage. While she would not use her Kekkei Genkai, she would still be the student who was the top of the class in this feild of Ninja Art. The two Genjutsu she really picked up here would be <strong>Demonic Illusion: False Surroundings</strong> Jutsu and it's superior version, <strong>Demonic Illusion: Double False Surroundings</strong> Jutsu. In the long run, she ended up making the top 10 in the class in Genjutsu.</div>
					<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;">Due to Kumogakure's lean towards Lightning Style and Kenjutsu, Matsuzaki would be tasked into trying to use few Lightning Style Jutsu to no avail. She would fail the examination on Lightning Jutsu, but would be marked an exception due to her being a transfere from another Land in it's entirty. Though Despite this, she would still do better than exspected at Kenjutsu, even if she did not do the best at it. As days went on, she would eventually go to pass in the top 10% of the Academy that year in the fields that she could handel. Sure, there were others that did way better than her, but she did not look down on anyone or look discouraged on the matter.</div>
					<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;">In her free time, she ussualy got into fights to test her self since her Ninjutsu was sparse and Taijutsu and Genjutsu is mostly what she had going for her. She would often not actually win her fights due to not using her Ketsuryūgan; yet, she would improve enough to get a few wins under her belt that could help her after graduation and to not rely on her Kekkei Genkai as much.</div>
					<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;">As years at the Academy went on, Matsuzaki would end up not using her Ketsuryūgan Kekkei Genkai for the entire three years she was in Kumogakure in essense to hide her being of the Chinoike Clan. During her last year there, her Taijutsu would be nearly up to par with an average Genin starting out and due to her <strong>illusionary Taijutsu</strong>, she would be a step above the rest in Taijutsu when she could actually use it. She only would be able to use it on those who knew nothing of her clan which was few and far between.</div>
					<h2><u>Acadamey Final Exam Spar</u></h2>
					<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;">During her finals, she would have to spar with one of the instructors to proove how well she could do as a Genin. At this point, the Acadamey could have caught on to her being one of those exhiled about a decade ago, but would still not say anything. She was instructed to go all out knowing that they would be able to win regardless of her strength. Before beginning, they would ask about her being of the Chinoike clan which caught her off guard completely. She did not exspect to hear it and froze. Her reaction to the name would have been enough answer to them. She was instructed to use her Ketsuryūgan if she could. Depending on how the spar went would determin if she was allowed to stay. She was hesitant, but would follow suit and activate her Ketsuryūgan specificaly in her left eye that was covered in her hair. Before doing so, they would notice her Heterochromia that is also often hidden by her hair and that for some reason, she only activated her Ketsuryūgan in her red eye.</div>
					<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;">After activating her Kekkei Genkai, she would quickly draw her Blood Katana to prepare to spar against the Jōnin. While she could not keep up with him at all in terms of speed, strength, or skill, she was able to keep up with his movements with her eyes to track him. She had uncanny Perception for a Pre-Genin, despite her Ketsuryūgan. Matsuzaki would barly be able to dodge him and her standard Genjutsu would appear to not work on him at all. It might have slowed him down a bit, but not enough to allow her to dodge his sword strikes that well. The proctor for the fight was someone who was well prepared to fight against the Ketsuryūgan and had a way to counter the Genjutsu.  Blow after blow, it would look like neither would faulter for quite a while, but her soon to be a Genin compared to the proctor being a Jōninm he was guarenteed to win the fight regardless. She would do quite well though landing a single sword slash onto him.</div>
					<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;">Despite actually cutting him with the sword, it was just a minor cut that barly drew any blood at all. That alone would have made her pass, but her being able to inflict a Genjutsu upon him would amplify that. She would not know he broke out of her Genjutsu, but would have another instructor stop the fight the moment Matsuzaki's blood katana drew his blood. The proctor would have been going easy on her and would have caught the lass by both of her arms after breaking her Genjutsu. While he did not have to do this, he would do this only to show that she did not win.</div>
					<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;">After breaking free, she would almost immediately be let go and told of her graduation. Matsuzaki would be told that no one besides the Jōnin that would be her squad captain would know about her being "Matsuzaki Chinoike". Her other two squad members would also be informed. She would then be handed the Steam Village headband that she would have originaly brougth with her without knowing that is what she had brought with her. After receiving her Headband from her village, she would almost cry out of happiness, but would wonder a bit.</div>
					<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;">"If I known for my clan that was ridiculed by the members of this village, why am I allowed to stay here then?" The proctors in the room would not answer her, but would reasure her that from the fight, they could tell she did not show any malicious intent. They would be a tad informative on why the requirement for her to stay til she turned eighteen or became a Jōnin herself was a requirement. It was an order to proove herself as trustworthy. There also was no incidents with the Chinoike for about a decade or longer at this point. With Matsuzaki Chinoike in the village for three to four years, there is no way she could have done anything. If she wanted to, she already would have.</div>
					<h2><u>Genin</u></h2>
					<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;">After being promoted to Genin, she would be instructed to meet her squad at the training grounds so she can meet and greet everyone. She could introduce herself as just "Matsuzaki" if she wished or if she was brave enough, she could use her full name. This is where the story begins for her in this land.</div>

				<div>Matsuzaki fights using her own illusionary world boundy by her Ketsuryūgan. Anything goes and often likes to go to one of two extreams. Often at the same time using Double False Surroundings to hide a blood filled landscape often associated with Chinoike Genjutsu inside of a highly realistic illusion with minor deviations to have her opponets smack themselves in the fact by running into stray trees and rocks that are not there while also avoiding obsticles that look natural to the enviorment that are not really there. After learning how to control animals and create controlable animals out of blood, she can use them as either weapons to inflict her specialized Genjutsu or as intel gathering.</div>
