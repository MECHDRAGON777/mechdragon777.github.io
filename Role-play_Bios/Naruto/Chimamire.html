			<h2>Early life</h2
			<div style="text-indent: 2em;">When Chimamire was younger, her parents told her of the tragedy of her clan at the hands of the Uchiha with out the full knowledge that it was of cause from the Raikage of the time or the fuedal lords of Kumogakure. As a result of being told of this fate at such a young age, it dramaticly shaped her to dispise the clan. This event is what allowed her to unlock her Ketsuryūgan through the preasure of what she had been told and how her life could have been so much better if the events of the past have never came to furision.</div>
			<br>
			<div tyle="text-indent: 2em;">Chimamire would train privately at home for a while starting at the age of seven. After about three years of training in the Valley of Hell, she would eventually get lost when going out from the Valley with her family near the boarders of Kumogakure. While her family was searching for her after she got lost, they ended up being attacked by bandits that were on their tail. While being seperated from her family would have been a bit tramatic on her, she would not know that they would have died due to an attack that would have also killed her if she never got lost in the process.</div>
			<br>
			<h2>Wild Life</h2>
			<div tyle="text-indent: 2em;">During the time she was lost, she was constantly attacked by animals in the woods that she often had to use for food. She had nothing but the sword she used for training over her time. As the days turned to weaks, the attacks would eventually slow as less and less animals would be in the area to attack her. About a weak into her being in the forest, her katana shattered from killing one of the wolves in the vacinity. Around the same time she would have used her Ketsuryūgan for the first time due to the forced bloodshed she witnessed every day just to eat and her Katana shattering.</div>
			<br>
			<div tyle="text-indent: 2em;">Due to her now using her Ketsuryūgan as her only means to fight off the wild animals to eat, she would then be forced to learn how to use it. She would begin by trying to focus her chakra into the blood she has been covered in. While she would struggle with seperating the blood from her clothing, she would eventually do it when the next wolf attacked her out of sheer shock and fear. She would eventually learn how to activate her Ketsuryūgan at will due to this event.</div>
			<br>
			<div tyle="text-indent: 2em;">Being used to Kenjutsu, she would then try to use her broken katana as a catalyst for her chakra to control the blood around her. Chimamire would eventually forge the blood around her into that of a blade. She would eventually try to cut stuff with the broken blade to feel the difference and while the blade of blood would cut easier than her training katana, she would notice a strain on her chakra from just maintaining the blade. She would then decide to store the blood in the sheeth of her training katana as a result while she was not using her Ketsuryūgan.</div>
			<h2>Ninja Academy</h2>
			<div tyle="text-indent: 2em;">Chimamire was eventually found by Kumo-nin around the boarders of Kumogakure. When she was found, she was covered in blood of the wolves and other animals in the area that she would have used to survive the three weeks in the wild. When she was found, she was questioned on why she was out there in the first place where she would meantion that she got lost after being seperated from her family weeks ago. It is now that she would find out that her parents would have been dead for some time and were found about a kilometer away from where she was found. Their corpes would have been found with their eye's removed from their skulls. Through deduction, it would be clear they were the girl's parents based off her what she told the ninja from Kumogakure.</div>
			<br>
			<div tyle="text-indent: 2em;">She was taken to Kumogakure and cleaned up and was offered to join the ninja accademy in Kumogakure. While she accepted, she was more depressed after learning the truth of why her family never came to find her. While she was a tad happy to be in Kumogakure after being told her clan was exhiled from the same village, she would still have mixed feelings. She would eventually enroll in the academy a bit late due to not even being form the village. Due to the stories she was told in her past, she would refrain from using her Ketsuryūgan in public or near anyone really. She did not want to be experdited out of the village just becasue of her clan.</div>
			<br>
			<div tyle="text-indent: 2em;">The fear of not showing anyone her Ketsuryūgan would result in her eventually learning how to activate her Ketsuryūgan in only her left eye if she needed it where her hair covered her eye. Despite being a Occular jutsu based Kekkei Genkai that was used for Genjutsu, she never learned how to use genjutsu from the Ketsuryūgan anyway. Over the two years there, she would have graduated at around the top 25% or so of her class, Chimamire would have mixed emotions about even being a ninja from a forein land.</div>
