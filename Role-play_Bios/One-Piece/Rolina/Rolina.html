				<h1 id="Backstory">[ Backstory ]</h1>
				<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>Age 2:</strong> When Rolina was a young lass, she stumbled upon the Weatherian’s Balloon Ship and was not found til a day after Weatheria had long passed where Zou was. With little control over the direction and speed of where the Sky Island of Weatheria would travel due to the winds of the world, the Weatherians would take the young Mink in. The young Rolina would like the home she would be given in the sky, though every once in a while loaned for her normal island’s nature a tad bit which formed her refusal to abandon the speech-patterns associated with her tribe. She would still be too young to remember her actual parents from Zou.</div>
				<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>Age 4:</strong> After living in the White Sea for a couple of years, she would soon become interested in what the Weatherians did and learned that the weather that she only experienced a little bit over her two years of living prior was due to what the Weatherians do every so often. This would also be around the point she started to understand that she had Electro in the first place due to being a Mink.</div>
				<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;">The Weatherians ended up teaching her quite a bit of the technological advancements of the Weatherians as well as other stuff that any young kid would need to know. She would end up being taught how to hold writing apparatus, but never how to read proper words. In the grand scheme of things, she ended up developing her own writing system unique to her that she could read as she got older.</div>
				<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>Age 6:</strong> When Rolina hit the six year mark on her life-span, she would start to develop her Electro a bit and one of the Weatherians would then toss her a Staff to train her in self-defense for when she would eventually need to leave Weatheria when she was old enough. He would note that her strikes would be electrifying and would note that she might be interested in learning that there is a special type of fruit in the world that grants people strange and mystical abilities at the cost of their ability to swim. After the time sparing, she was capable of holding off a standard nuciase trying to pick on her if she ever had to, but would hopefully never need to.</div>
				<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>Age 7:</strong> When Rolina turned seven, she seemed to be more hesitant in her will to attack the Weatherian that would spar with her ever so often to train her. While she trained to keep herself safe, she started to want to focus more so on what her opponent’s would start to do before reacting with her own defensive parrys.</div>
				<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;">When she was finished with as much training the Weatherians could give her in sparring, they would notice that not once that the Mink picked up that the weapon they gave her to spar with was not a typical Bo-Staff, but instead a Climatact, despite being told of it’s potential. They hoped that one day, she would finally learn how to use the Climatact with the remaining knowledge they would have been passing down over the years.</div>
				<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>Age 12:</strong> Rolina would have started to pick up some of her trade-mark attire when she turned 12 in key to her electro. She would have a cape fashioned out of copper in hopes that she could one day use her “natural gift” as she thought of it to better redirect attacks from her blind spot, but never really understood that it would never work. She kept it for the most part due to thinking it would look cool. She would also start fantasizing over a few Devil Fruits based on what she heard from the Weatherians over the years. More specifically the fruits that were more weather oriented such as the Rumble Rumble fruit, Snow Snow fruit, and Gas Gas fruit being the three fruits she often fantasizes the most about. Seeing that her Electro practically is what she was told of the Rumble Rumble fruit, she typically thinks about it less and less. She often thinks that a weather based Devil Fruit would honor what she had been taught and has enjoyed topically since she was a young lass. Her Mink-blood often makes her suffer from the heat when Weatheria passes the hotter parts of the world which makes her long for the Snow Snow fruit specifically. Rolina also starts chronicling her life from this point in her free time when she has any.</div>
				<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>Age 14:</strong> Rolina would begin being taught how to read the weather in areas around where she is which greatly delights her. He also gives her the bright idea of embedding a barometer into some insulated gloves to read the atmospheric pressure of the area she is in and also is taught how to read it and what it means; however, due to her lack of field-training, she was never able to understand the importance of the barometer she had in her right glove. Rolina however would write down what the Weatherians taught her about weather reading and so on in her note book.</div>
				<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>Age 18:</strong> When Rolina turned 18, Weatheria would have passed over Flevance where she would be taken with the group to be dropped off with her Climatact and weather equipment due to being of age. She would continue to long for her homeland of Zou, but would note that once she got to Flevance, she would be comfortable due to her Mink-blood resonating with the colder air better than a few places Weatheria passed by. She would set-up shop as a local meteorologist, but at her current skill level, she would only be able to provide info on the current weather instead of how the weather will play out in the future. She would occasionally use her free time for sparing in her home in Flevance.</div>

				<div>Rolina never really got a grasp on how to use the weapon that she was given correctly and tends to use it as a standard Bo-Staff instead of as a tool for using the weather against her attackers.</div>

				<div><strong>Electric Twirl:</strong> By spinning her Climatact like a standard Bo-Staff one-handed, she channels her Electro through the Climatact in an almost-spherical shape capable of blocking most standard projectiles.</div>
				<div><strong>Electropop:</strong> After twirling her Climatact, Rolina can grip one end of her Climatact in a swinging motion to use the staff like a slicing blunt-spear charged with Electro.</div>
				<div><strong>Electro-parry:</strong> When an opponent would launch a Melee attack, Rolina would hold her Climatact in such a way that she could use her opponent’s momentum against them effectively redirecting their blow back at them.</div>
