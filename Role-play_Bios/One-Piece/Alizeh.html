			<div><strong>Personality: Alizeh is usually a calm girl who likes to eat sweets. In her free time when she is not hunting down marine officers. She does not really like being a warlord of the sea, but abuses her position to get away with slaughtering the marines without them knowing.

			<h1 id="Backstory">[ Backstory ]</h1>
			<div class="backstoryindent">When Alizeh was six years old, a group of Pirates found her on Ice Island in Totto Land and took her in for a little bit of time. A Bit later that same night, she would keep asking stories of their adventure which had them genuinely heart-felt to the girl. About two days later, a Marine Ship came rolling up to Attack the Pirates that were using Ice Island as their hideout. Due to the Marines “invading” time; they ended up mistaking her as a Spy for the Marines and the Marines thought she was one of the Pirates due to seeing she was on the island and not having anyone else on the island at the time. Both groups ended up attacking her as a result and ended up slicing her left arm clean off when she tried to defend herself while the other group ended up cutting her from her head to her waist leaving a massive scar and removing her left eye. After the Marines noticed she was cut by the Pirates instead of defending her, they later took her off to the North Blue for Medical Treatment.</div>
			<div class="backstoryindent">Around three months later after she was nearly close to recovering, another group of Pirates ended up invading where she was taken to whose goal at the time was to kidnap any children who were in the Marine’s care in fear that they would grow up to be a threat later in life. Due to being blinded by their goal, they ended up also taking Alizeh as well who was in critical condition at the time. In order to have her not join the Marines when she was older, the crew did everything they could to keep her calm and happy after she recovered which is where the crew got the name “Sweet Pirates” from. She was often given a different sweet every day until one day, she “accidentally” served a Devil Fruit in place of cake. The Captain of the “now Sweet Pirates” ended up intentionally ordering the cook of the ship to serve the Wind Wind Fruit to the young Alizeh under the impression that a Devil Fruit could help her get her arm back.</div>
			<div class="backstoryindent">Upon eating the Devil Fruit, her body ended up becoming near weightless as a side effect of the fruit and has lost the ability to gain weight at all. Upon eating it, all she knew was that she ate the “Wind Wind Fruit” and that her weight was astronomically reduced to that of a mere three ounces. Over time, she did learn it was a blessing and has been able to move faster and can eat as many Sweets as she wants. Alizeh has also had to consciously control her own gravity as a result of this side-effect.</div>
			<div class="backstoryindent">As the years went on, she was trained in the art of swordsmanship in order to fend off any Marines that would want to hurt her in the future. Alizeh eventually became a master swordsman herself and became the Vice Captain of the crew at the age of ten after she bested the best swordsman of their crew in a one on one duel. After becoming the Vice Captain, her Captain started training her on how to use her Devil Fruit the best she could using the Devil Fruit Encyclopedia to figure out what the fruit’s capabilities were. She was trained for two years on how to use the Wind Wind Fruit.</div>
			<div class="backstoryindent">As time went on, she eventually figured out how to make her body intangible at the age of thirteen. She later went on to figure out that she can not only be phased through, but also manipulate the wind itself, even if she cannot change the contents of the air itself. Her new-found ability with her fruit was then able to allow her to suggest to her captain to sail towards the Grand Line. She was revered as a strong swordsman who fought with an invisible blade. Her bounty would increase from 0 𝕭 to 46,000,000 𝕭 after destroying a Marine Ship in the Grand Line.</div>
			<div class="backstoryindent">After taking on two islands in the Grand Line, she was taught how to use Haki by her captain who also gave her a Last name  of “Yeunova” and the initial “X.” to give her a place to call home. Alizeh X. Yeunova became a master of Armament Haki’s concepts quite easily, but ended up being bad at Observation Haki. She was warned of what Observation Haki could allow her opponent’s if they were skilled in it. By the time they got to Storm Isle, Alizeh was turning fourteen.</div>
			<div class="backstoryindent">Upon Arriving at Storm Isle, they encountered the Harpy Pirates (Who have been a crew captained by a Warlord for hundreds of years) and ended up having her Captain and Mother figure killed by the twelve year old Queen, Xelyth. The result ended up with Xelyth and Alizeh clashing for an hour; but ultimately, Alizeh was defeated and heavily injured while Xelyth was left unscathed. Both of them would learn they had Conqueror’s Haki during the fight. Alizeh was made the third Captain of the Sweet Pirates that day and would cause her to hate Harpies with a passion. The resulting clash would have brought Alizeh’s bounty up to 135,000,000 𝕭.
			<div class="backstoryindent">During the crew’s recovery, they remained hidden near the sky island for a Log Pose change before leaving off the island. After eventually leaving for Water Seven, Alizeh took to training more with her Devil Fruit  a bit more drastically til she could control her own body’s tangibility as well as coating her Wind Blade with Armament Haki.</div>
