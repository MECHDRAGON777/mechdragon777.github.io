			<h1><strong>[ Personal Details ]</strong></h1>
			<div><strong>Personality:</strong> Yeserin is not the brightest and is more bird than human or mink due to her parents being a half-mink harpy and a half-human harpy. She was smart enough to figure out that she had to escape her cousin's pirate crew as she was pretty much a prisioner who just supplied strength to carry the warlord's ship through the skies. She is pretty much an "attack bird" for the Marines, but over the years, she has finaly been trained to differenciate people based on their personality instead of their clothing. She yearns to be free as she feels that even the Marines are using her.</div>
			<br>
			<div><strong>Appearance:</strong> Yeserin is a bird-brained girl who is a decendent of two differnt Harpy Chimeras made by Æstrid D. Lambdadelta. One Human/Bird, the other a Mink/Bird. Effectifly making her an electric-Harpy that does not appear to be of the Mink race. As a result of her genes, she is able to produce electricity out of her feathers located on her wings, tail, and legs, and a magnetic field from her skin. She wears a small skirt that is removeable like a jacket that is attached by a belt on her left side. Her feathers resemble lightning bolts in color and shape and her tail is even shaped like a lightning bolt. She wears a metal chest plate that is shaped like two lightning bolts and is attached to her by her skin's natural magnatism.</div>
			<br>
			<div><strong>Aspiration(s):</strong> Yeserin aspires to be a free bird and take down her Cousin who is a Warlord of the Sea.</div>
			<div><strong>Likes:</strong> Explosions, Pirates (freedom), Electricity, Bird Seed</div>
			<div><strong>Dislikes:</strong> Her Cousin (Xelyth Hynialle Arya Lyvaeno)</div>

			<h1>BACKSTORY</h1>
			<h2><u><em>Harpy Pirates</em></u></h2>
			<div style="text-indent: 24px;">Yeserin would spend most of her Childhood being prisoner by her older Cousin who was only four years older than her in the Harpy Pirates crew. She was one of the Pirate's Carrier Harpies due to being born from a Mink based Harpy instead of a Human based Harpy. Through her torturous youth, she has gotten the habit of losing control over her electricity emitted from her electro-magnetic body when she is not in control. Partially due to being a a Mink who had her genes altered by one who does not understand what Minks are.</div>
			<br>
			<div style="text-indent: 24px;">While most of the Higher class Royalty on Storm Isle would be treated like Queens, Yeserin would not get that privilege and would be treated worse than the female halfas on the island. When she was on Storm Isle, she would be constantly chained to the summit of the castle of the island near the storm wall while the winds would attempt to eat away at her flesh. If her electro-magnetic skin did not repel the winds from cutting her, she would have died to the torture every day; thus, leaving her body quite weak.</div>
			<br>
			<div style="text-indent: 24px;">While on Voyages around the White Sea, and Paradise, Yeserin and the other 199 Carrier Harpies had to suffer the weight of the entire flag-ship just so the crew's top officer's could sail the skies in luxury. The standard affair for them would be to be strapped in a harness with a few ropes on their back and order them to fly in a specified direction for hours on end til they are beyond exhausted.</div>
			<br>
			<div style="text-indent: 24px;">When her Cousin became a Warlord of the Sea in her teens, the terrible treatment got worse and worse. Yeserin could not take the slave-labor much longer and during an expedition to a Marine Summon, she decided to get away by the silliest way possible; by playing dead in the ocean next to the Marine HQ. While she was their, her cousin left her for dead which did allow her to flee suggested the Navy did not find her.</div>
			<h2><u><em>Impel Down</em></u></h2>
			<div style="text-indent: 24px;">Due to how most of the world saw Harpies as well as knowing the Harpy Pirates left her their, the Marines sent her to Impel Down with weighted sea-prism-stone handcuffs around her shoulders and legs and sentenced to level 1. Due to the months in Impel Down, she would be left with millions a small pricks in the bottom of her feet. Not enough to cause harm due to her race, but they were stil mildly annoying. Her wings being shackled in rubber and sea-prism-stone would make her wings unarmed, but her flesh would be ripped asunder. The pain would be equivalent of what what Storm Isle's razor winds did with her electro-magnetic field around her body.</div>
			<br>
			<div style="text-indent: 24px;">Yeserin would eventually get used to the pain of having her flesh ripped off her body like anyone else in Impel Down. She would never make the jump down to Level 2 due to thinking that if she was a good girl, she would be released as she spent her entire life under slavery to her own cousin and queen. She never did anything while in there and she never screamed like a normal person would do. She would often just collapse from the pain. In it's own way, Impel Down would be it's own training ground for her, and despite being the most secure prison in the world, it would be the most freedom Yeserin would have up to this point in her life.</div>
			<br>
			<div style="text-indent: 24px;">Being cut would feel like her terrible childhood, but other than that, she could at least move around as much as she wanted. While it is hard to cut her feet, what bit of her arms were actually arms and not wings as well as her stomach would still be exposed to getting cut. She eventually learned how to run around Level 1 without getting close to the trees, her magnetic skin would just force her into them anyway. When she finally was given the benefit of the doubt, she would be given two weeks to recover before being discharged; however, it would not be the freedom she has longed for.</div>
			<br>
			<div style="text-indent: 24px;">Though due to the Harpy Pirates never coming to make any demands what-so-ever and showing no concern, Yeserin would be let out of Impel Down if she worked for the Marines. While she did agree in hopes of taking down her Cousin, she later learned her cousin is actually an ally of the Marines and in her eyes, she was still a prisoner of fate. No mater where she turned, she would be forced to do something she did not want to do.</div>
			<h2><u><em>Marine training</em></u></h2>
			<div style="text-indent: 24px;">She has been a chore-girl for quite a while and though she does obtain a few ranks, she sees the torture of the work quite cruel. Eventually, she would be transferred tot he East Blue and would be given an order she would be mildly excited for. "Infiltrate a pirate crew and report back with details." Essential, she would work as a Pirate Crew's Chronicler and secretly send it by Carrier Seagull to the Marines, in exchange, she would have a unique bounty poster that would instead of having "Belly" on it, it would say: <b>Wanted Alive Only</b>, and the B for Belly would be replaced with a P for Prestige with the number scratched out.</div>
            <br>
			<div style="text-indent: 24px;">She would be given special training til she reached the rank of Ensign where she would learn to fight and was ordered to follow the orders of who ever her "so-called Captain" would be with some exceptions. While hating the type of mental training, she followed since it would eventually be a piece of the puzzle to take down her cousin from her thrown in the sky.</div>
            <br>
			<div style="text-indent: 24px;">Yeserin would end up being the rank of Ensign by the point she was finally put up for rent by the Navy in accordance with her mission. The goal would be for the Marine to act like she hated the Navy in front of her new "so called crew" which would be easy since no faking would be required. The job would also net the Navy with Intel on all actions that other Pirates are doing while she is under cover. She was also instructed to not actually harm Marines if she got into a fight with them.</div>
            <br>
			<div style="text-indent: 24px;">She would be waiting in an electric cell in a Marine base forced to remain conscious to not keep her wings away from everything to prevent her from causing damage while she was unconscious. Her wings would be left encased in rubber as if her wings were blades and the rubber sleeves would hide her wings and double as sheaths for a sword.</div>
