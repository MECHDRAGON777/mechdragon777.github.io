			<h1><strong>[ Personal Details ]</strong></h1>
			<div><strong>Personality:</strong> Yeserin is not the brightest and is more bird than human or mink due to her parents being a half-mink harpy and a half-human harpy. She was smart enough to figure out that she had to escape her cousin's pirate crew as she was pretty much a prisioner who just supplied strength to carry the warlord's ship through the skies. She is pretty much an "attack bird" for the Marines, but over the years, she has finaly been trained to differenciate people based on their personality instead of their clothing. She yearns to be free as she feels that even the Marines are using her.</div>
			<br>
			<div><strong>Appearance:</strong> Yeserin is a bird-brained girl who is a decendent of two differnt Harpy Chimeras made by Æstrid D. Lambdadelta. One Human/Bird, the other a Mink/Bird. Effectifly making her an electric-Harpy that does not appear to be of the Mink race. As a result of her genes, she is able to produce electricity out of her feathers located on her wings, tail, and legs, and a magnetic field from her skin. She wears a small skirt that is removeable like a jacket that is attached by a belt on her left side. Her feathers resemble lightning bolts in color and shape and her tail is even shaped like a lightning bolt. She wears a metal chest plate that is shaped like two lightning bolts and is attached to her by her skin's natural magnatism.</div>
			<br>
			<div><strong>Aspiration(s):</strong> Yeserin aspires to be a free bird and take down her Cousin who is a Warlord of the Sea.</div>
			<div><strong>Likes:</strong> Explosions, Pirates (freedom), Electricity, Bird Seed</div>
			<div><strong>Dislikes:</strong> Her Cousin (Xelyth Hynialle Arya Lyvaeno)</div>

			<h1>BACKSTORY</h1>
			<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 8px;">Yeserin would spend most of her Childhood being prisoner by her older Cousin who was only four years older than her in the Harpy Pirates crew. She was one of the Pirate's Carrier Harpies due to being born from a Mink based Harpy instead of a Human based Harpy. Through her torturous youth, she has gotten the habit of losing control over her electricity emited from her electro-magnetic body when she is not in control. Partialy due to being a a Mink who had her genes altered by one who does not understand what Minks are.</div>
			<br>
			<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 8px;">While most of the Higher class Royalty on Storm Isle would be treated like Queens, Yeserin would not get that privleage and would be treated worse than the female halfas on the island. When she was on Storm Isle, she would be constantly chained to the summit of the castle of the island near the storm wall while the winds would attempt to eat away at her flesh. If her electro-magnetic skin did not repel the winds from cutting her, she would have died to the torture every day; thus, leaving her body quite weak.</div>
			<br>
			<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 8px;">While on Voyages around the White Sea, and Paradise, Yeserinand the other 199 Carrier Harpies had to suffer the weight of the entire flag-ship just so the crew's top officer's could sail the skies in luxuray. The standard affair for them would be to be strapped in a harness with a few ropes on their back and order them to fly in a specified direction for hours on end til they are beyond exhausted.</div>
			<br>
			<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 8px;">When her Cousin became a Warlord of the Sea in her teens, the terrible treatment got worse and worse. Yeserin could not take the slave-labor much longer and during an expidition to a Marine Summon, she decided to get away by the silliest way possible; by playing dead in the ocean next to the Marine HQ. While she was their, her cousin left her for dead which did allow her to flee suggested the Navy did not find her.</div>
			<br>
			<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 8px;">Due to how most of the world saw Harpies as well as knowing the Harpy Pirates left her their, the Marines sent her to Impel Down with weighted sea-prism-stone handcuffs around her shoulders and legs and sentenced to level 1. Though due to the Harpy Pirates never coming to make any demands what-so-ever and showing no concern; she would be let out if she worked for them. While she did agree in hopes of taking down her Cousin, she later learned her cousin is actually an ally of the Marines and in her eyes, she was still a prisoner of fate.</div>
			<br>
			<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 8px;">She has been a chore-girl for quite a while and though she does obtain a few ranks, she sees the torture of the work quite creul. Eventually, she would be transfered tot he East Blue and would be given an order she would be mildly excited for. "Infltrait a pirate crew and report back with details." Essentialy, she would work as a Pirate Crew's Chronicler and secretly send it by Carrier Seagull to the Marines, in exchange, she would have a unique bounty poster that would instead of having "Belly" on it, it would say: <strong>Wanted Alive Only,</strong> and the B for Belly would be replaced with a P for Prestige with the number scratched out.</div>
            <br>
			<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 8px;">She would be given special training til she reached the rank of Ensign where she would learn to fight and was ordered to follow the orders of who ever her "so-called Captain" would be with some exceptions. While hating the type of mental training, she followed since it would eventually be a piece of the puzzle to take down her cousin from her thrown in the sky.</div>
            <br>
			<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 8px;">Yeserin would end up bieng the rank of Ensign by the point she was finally put up for rent by the Navy in accordance with her mission. The goal would be for the Marine to act like she hated the Navy infront of her new "so called crew" which would be easy since no faking would be required. The job would also net the Navy with intel on all actions that other Pirates are doing while she is under cover. She was also instructed to not actually harm Marines if she got into a fight with them.</div>
            <br>
			<div class="tab" style="text-indent: 8px;">She would be waiting in an electric cell in a Marine base forced to remain councious to not keep her wings away from everything to prevent her from causing damage while she was uncouncious. Her wings would be left incased in rubber as if her wings were blades and the rubber sleeves would hide her wings and double as sheeths for a sword.</div>
