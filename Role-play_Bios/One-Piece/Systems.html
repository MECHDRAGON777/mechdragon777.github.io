This stat also helps keep hold of others, lift weight, grip, as well as force from ranged attacks (Not applicable to guns, but for slingshots, etc.). An appreciable level of this statistic is required for ranged fighters to use complex and powerful weapons. In addition, Strengthalso reduces the effort required for instance....a person is able to knock out his opponet with relatively higher strength. <u>There can't be a huge difference between endurance and strength.</u></em></div>
				<br>
				<div><b>Agility:</b> <em>Agility is the measure of how quickly a character could move. It is also one of the major determinat factors for movement. Agility could be utilized for evasion techniques, but note that without enough perception, one would still be struck with an attack regardless of their agility. In addition, such characters are also capable of performing a shower of multiple attacks. As for ranged fighters, this is the ability to reload and fire at a faster rate.</em></div>
				<br>
				<div><b>Perception:</b> <em>Perception is the measure of a character and his/her perspective ability. It is a great attribute for ranged fighters as it primarily affects reaction time and aim. Although, a reasonable speed would also be required to evade attacks. It is an invaluable asset for ranged fighters with no doubt, but an appropriate amount of perception is also required for melee fighters, as one won't be able to land any ahits without this stat.</em></div>

				<div><b>Endurance:</b> <em>This stat is the measure of one's durability and mental grit. Characters with a high value in this attribute are more likely to survive attacks, wounds, poisons or diseases. Endurance is the represenative of one's toughness and grit. Endurance is also a type of resistance against sickness and injury proneness.</em></div>

				<div><em><u>'To The Grand Line'</u> is an exclusive RP mode, The core of the server that allows both marine squadrons and pirate crews to go on an adventure.

				<h2 id="TB"><u>The Blues</u></h2>
				<div><em>The Blues are four oceans that cover much of the world: North Blue, East Blue, South Blue, and West Blue. They are divided by the Grand Line and Red Line and are dotted with islands that can be easily navigated using conventional navigation methods. In contrast to the hazardous Grand Line, the Blues are relatively peaceful. The islands in the Blues are rarely dangerous, the seas are calm and individuals of notable strength are rare.</em></div>

				<div><em>The Calm Belts are two areas that are just north and south of the Grand Line.</em></div>

			<div class="indent">
				<h2 id="Wr"><u>Weather</u></h2>
				<div><em>The currents and weather are extremely volatile, as they can change in an instant; this includes water spoutes, storms, blizzards, and other such things. Islands and the surrounding waters are the only areas where weather and currents are stabilized in a predictable manner. The reason for this is that islands on the Grand Line fall into four basic categories: Summer, Spring, Autumn, and Winter.</em></div>

				<div><em><b>Reverse Mountain</b> is an extremely tall mountain at one of the points where the four Blues meet and is one of the two known entrances to the Grand Line. It is located in the Red Line and is the geographical antipode of <b>Mary Geoise</b> and is also one of the obstacles that you must go through.

Anyone can atain the rank of captaincy out of pure leadership, as a founding member, or voted by other crew members. All major decisions are made by them, though they may be usually advised and influenced by other members. Although a captain may be the highest authority of the crew, there are situations where they are betrayed, overthrown, and even killed in mutinies. Although rare, there are a few captains who take on a role within the crew in addition to their captaincy.</li>
					<li>
						<b>Combatants:</b> These are the crewmates who are capable of fighting. This class is an exception to the professions system and are free of occupational <b>(TP)</b> costs.

						<div><b>Tier 1:</b> Combatant gets <b>3+ (TP)</b> at start.</div>
						<div><b>Tier 2:</b> A Combatant gets <b>Double (TP)</b> every five levels.</div>

Often this position is shared with a Boatswain who would tend to the sails or other parts of the ship that do not directly deal with the foundation of a vessel. However, even the most advanced shipwrights cannot fix a boat that is beyond repair.

				<div>Beats are creatures in the wild that could be hunted to yield meat or other rare obtainables with prestigious value. <em><u><b>An archaeologist or beat tamer is required to identify rare beats.</b></u></em></div>
				<br>
				<div><em>A <b>Beast Tamer</b> can also be utilized to tame such creatures with unique abilities as well as trap animals to hunt them.</em></div>
				<br>
				<div><em><b>Beasts are classified in three types:</b></em></div>
				<br>
				<br>
				<div><b>'C-Type'</b> <em>animals include those with little to no predatory threat such as reptiles, avians, rodents, fish, etc. They are of low value and often are the reason of plagues and annoyance to locals.</em></div>
				<br>
				<div><b>'B-Type'</b> <em>animals specifically include larger herbivores of great value as livestock. This classification includes various types of deer, bulls, farm animals, and large fish. They are of great value and could reward decently.</em></div>
				<br>
				<div><b>'A-Type'</b> <em>or the savage classification is one of the most vast and valuable kind. This also includes extremely predatory and savage creatures as well as rare and bothersome animals such as Humandrills, Blugori, Various Sea Kings, Flying Fish, Horned Shark, Big Tiger, etc.</em></div>
