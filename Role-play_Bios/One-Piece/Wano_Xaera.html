			<h1 id="Personal Details">[ Personal Details ]</h1>
			<div><strong>Personality:</strong> A level headed girl who tends to think rationally. Does not like the concept of Devil Fruits, but after her sister’s death, her mother became more protective of her thus not allowing for much freedom outside of studying medical practice. Xæra tends to think things through most of the time and can stay calm under unusually stressful situations.</div>
			<br>
			<div><strong>Appearance:</strong> Xæra is a Harpy who was originally a Human with long white hair who often keeps her hair in the shape of cat-ears. She wears a Kimono whose sleeves are open enough to allow even her wings to fit in a concealed manner. She hides her tail in her Kimono while in public. She keeps a Plague Doctor Mask on to hide her age from others when she stays in an area too long. Her eyes are a deep red and often appear to be calm and shy. The biggest giveaway about her not being human anymore would be her talons. Her wings are attached slightly below her shoulder.</div>
			<br>
			<div><strong>Aspiration(s):</strong> To keep her family ties of being a family of doctors as well as to save Flevance from the White Lead Disease.</div>
			<div><strong>Likes:</strong> Clouds, Cold, Storms, Birds, Cats</div>
			<div><strong>Dislikes:</strong> Devil Fruits</div>

			<h1 id="Backstory">[ Backstory ]</h1>
			<div class="tab">Xæra was born over seven hundred years before the current Queen of the Harpies took the throne and lived a sheltered life for the first seventy or so years of her life after her younger sister died by falling to her death at the age of four. Xæra was eight at the time and was locked in a room in Weatheria as a result til her sixteenth birthday at which her mother, Æstrid,  returned home in a gravely wounded state. When she found her mother was in such a “Wounded” state, she tried to help her mother out the best she could, but she lacked the proper medical knowledge at the time to save her. Over the last three days of her life, her mother decided to use her Devil Fruit’s ability on her daughter to give her ever-lasting youth. As a result, Xæra has the body of a sixteen year old Harpy.</div>
			<div class="tab">After the sacrifice of the Ageless Surgery, her Father, Æðelwine Lambdadelta has taken her from island to island every so many years where she eventually found a guy who she fell in love with at the age of twenty, but due to her body’s secret, she was taken away from there four years later leaving a new-born Harpy in the North Blue before moving again. Before long, she carried the tradition of moving to a new island every five to ten years after her father died at the age of 97. Every time she arrives at a new island, she would claim to be sixteen and looking for work. In her spare time, she found hobbies of studying weather patterns like her family did originally before becoming a family of medical professionals.</div>
			<div class="tab">Most of her time has been spent treating the ill on the new islands she explored every so often that she became seen as that of a plague doctor. She had little time to explore her passion for the weather and it took her decades to find a way to control the weather before eventually using her country’s research to eventually get a Clima Tact. She has used it to cause rainfall on the islands she visited more often than not and to stop rain when the islands were experiencing floods.</div>
			<div class="tab">Around the age of 135, Xæra stopped visiting the White Sea all together to visit the Blues, although she could never fly through the Calm Belt; as a result, she always remained flying between the North Blue and the White Sea. After being seen as a plague doctor, she started carrying a plague doctor's mask with her which she always wears during an operation. The Islands she frequented the most would include the Lvneel Kingdom, Spider Miles, Flevance, Rubeck Island, Minion Island, Rakesh, and a few others. As she got older, she used her mask to hide her identity a bit more as Harpies became more and more prevalent in the world; however she would still not stay on the same island for more than two decades at a time when in hiding.</div>
			<div class="tab">In the present day, She has moved to Flevance recently and those that last saw her in the region would have mostly forgotten about her. She has been in the town of Flevance for a few weeks at this point in time; she has not been seen without her mask since she has arrived. Xæra is often seen in the Hospital in Flevance since her arrival during the day and can sometimes be seen at night either sleeping on the southern shore or practicing fighting with a bo-staff near the outskirts of town. With the spread of the White Lead Disease in Flevance, she was able to find out it was not a contagious disease based on her past visits to Flevance and the average age of deaths in the victims declining.</div>
			<div class="tab">Due to her realization with the cause of the Disease being the Lead itself and coming in contact with it, she has made it a goal of hers to find a cure for it at almost any cost. Over her years, she has spent most of her life trying to find a cure for White Lead Disease with not much luck. She has used her “Longevity” to her advantage looking for the cure; but has never found one in the North Blue.</div>
			<div class="tab">Xæra often avoids Germa due to the stories of the sea farrying country due to their ruthless nature and their will to conquer the entire North Blue. She is however aware of Germa’s technology and potential to find a cure, she however would like to find a more trustworthy solution to save the country and town of Flevance. While working in Flevance for over a century off and on, she has picked up quite a bit of medical knowledge.</div>
