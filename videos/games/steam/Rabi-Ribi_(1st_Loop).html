This is a cute Metroidvania that I got not for the Steam Summer Sale, but because it is a Metroidvania that I can spend some time in. Since I started the recording so early, my playing around on the main menu is also shown.</td>

        <td>Welcome everyone to Rabi-Ribi Part 14. Confession time.Parts 15 to 19 have been corrupted due to my hard drive running out of space. (It is the main reason my Rabi-Ribi and Metroid Prime Trilogy LPs are being released bi-daily). Essentially, the entire time I recorded, I had not space to record so the files was just 1KB to show they were 0 bytes... Parts 15 and 17 both take up more file size than part 13 (a 23 minute video). Here is a comparison of file sizes in Kilobytes.
Part 11: 52 minutes takes 579.302 KB.
Part 12: 1 hour and 33 minutes takes 1.173.319 KB.
Part 13: 23 minutes takes up 196.146 KB.
Part 14: 36 minutes takes 515.487 KB.
Part 15: Corrupted takes 374.273 KB.
Part 16: Corrupted takes 1KB.
Part 17: Corrupted takes 166.401 KB.
Part 18: Corrupted takes 1 KB.
Part 19: Corrupted takes 1 KB.
So please, go to part 20 after this. I tried uploading Parts 15 and 17 in the past. They just simply will not work on Youtube due to "Unsupported File Type" but really, they are just corrupted MP4s. I hope you all understand. The bossfight in this video (Kotri Blue) is also beaten in Part 15. So you sadly miss out on that dialog and such. By the time part ~80 to 90 come around, you may get to see that dialog. The games achievements require going to New Game +++ or start the 4th loop. I plan to get all achievements in this Video series, not just beat the game. I hope this compensates for the mistake of not checking my hard drive. (Exspect this to be a 1000+ part Series.)</td>

The community calls them Noah 1, Noah 2, and Noah 3, but that sounds weird to me. Also, was not Noah's name originally Erina anyway? Looks like Erina anyway... As for Miru, I did her fight damageless just to bring HP into Noah's fight. I got her dodgemaster achievement back when I thought it was damageless. That fight is done in part 50.</td>
