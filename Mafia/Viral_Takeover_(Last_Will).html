					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<div class="p">Hello everyone, I am Phoenix and I am the Bodyguard. What this means is I will perish if the person I protect would be attacked by anyone and save them if they are not being attacked by Pestilence. This town was quite nice, but everything must come to an in sooner of later. I have been in contact with SAStar since <strong>Day 2</strong> and have been helping out behind the scenes.</div>
					<h2>Visitations</h2>
					<div class="p">Due to being a Bodyguard, I have to use my ability to visit which is mandatory. If I had the choice, I would not use my ability and use it as a standard visit. So I have to hope I perish by visiting Pestilence and not by my own ablity.</div>
					<div class="p">
						<ul class="circle">
							<li>Night 1: <strong>SAStar</strong></li>
							<li>Night 2: <strong>SAStar</strong></li>
							<li>Night 3: <strong>FyreNova</strong></li>
							<li>Night 4: <strong>FyreNova</strong></li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<h2>Reads</h2>
					<div class="p2"><strong>Uranus:</strong> I have never been good at giving reads, but this player appears to be very town sided.</div>
					<div class="p3"><strong>FyreNova:</strong> Since I visited him the night I died, I say he is Pestilence.</div>
					<h2>Plan of Attack</h2>
					<div class="indent">Okay, this has gotten out of hand everyone. Starting at <strong>Day 5</strong> onward, we need to look at the last wills of <strong>EVERYONE</strong> and look specificialy at who they visited every night starting from <strong>Night 4</strong>. If they visited someone and lived, that means the person they visisted can <strong>NOT</strong> be Pestilence. On the contrary, just because someone died visiting a player does not mean that player is Pestilence. To find out if the player they visited is Pestilence or not, we need to collect data. To do this, we check if a person died and they visit someone. Let me give an example using only the people who have already died.</div>
					<div class="p">
						<table style="border:2px">
							<tr class="center">
								<th colspan="2">Night 4</th>
								<th colspan="2">Night 5</th>
								<th colspan="2">Night 6</th>

						<div class="indent">In this example, I am the Plaugebearer turned Pestilence. (Obviously I am not and I am the Bodyguard, but this is to showcase what I am talking about. From this data, you can see anyone who visited me would have died that same day. I only visited on Night 5 in this example and it was Jordandiablo. You would not be able to see my visits by that point, but those that visted Jordandiablo perished, but Jordandiablo would have as well. There is also the fact SAStar did not die to visiting Jordandiablo. However, you notice that Helmet and Swiss would have died by visiting me.</div>
						<div class="indent">Basicaly, what I am saying is pay attention to other's last wills. Keep track of who can be visited safely. If I saw these, I would keep a steady eye out. What we SHOULD do is check the last will of those that died tonight (Night 4) and track down simularities. For instance, I visited FyreNova. If anyone else died tonight and also visited FyreNova the same night, FyreNova is who we should vote for.</div>
						<h2>Extra Fluff</h2>
						<span class="flipH">
							<div class="indent">I give my Cryokinesis kit to SAStar to allow him to freeze the planet solid should he so desire. I also loan him my Articunos as someone would need to look after them. I also give TheHelmetGuy01 a helmet made of pure ice. I give Eclipsed a clock that tracks in miliseconds.</div>
