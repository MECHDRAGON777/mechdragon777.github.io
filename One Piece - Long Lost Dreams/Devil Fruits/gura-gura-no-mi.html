				<h1 id="Demographics">[ Gura Gura no Mi ]</h1>
				<div>The <strong>Gura Gura no Mi</strong> is a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit which allows the user to create vibrations, or "quakes", making the user a <strong>Tremor Human</strong> (震動人間, Shindō Ningen?).</div>
				<div>This fruit is fearsomely reputed to be able to destroy the world, and is considered to be the strongest Devil Fruit within the Paramecia class, having powers no weaker than those of a Logia Devil Fruit.</div>
			</div>
			<hr>
			<div class="indent">
				<h1 id="Physical Details">[ Etymology ]</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>"Guragura" (グラグラ/ぐらぐら) is a Japanese onomatopoeia describing loose, irregular/unstable movements (shaking, wobbling, etc.), such as the shaking during an earthquake.</li>
			</ul></div>
			<hr>
			<div class="indent">
				<h1 id="Relationships">[ Strengths and Weaknesses ]</h1>
				<div>The primary strength granted by the Gura Gura no Mi is its user's ability to generate massive vibrations, or shockwaves, which can travel through virtually any medium, including the ground, seafloor, and even the air. Due to this capability, it's said that the user holds the power to potentially destroy the world, with nowhere being safe from the fruit's full might, not even the remotest corners of the ocean.</div>
				<br>
				<div>The user can effortlessly devastate an entire island, though there are noticeable limitations. Destroying large structures or entire bases may require repeated use of the fruit’s power. In some cases, structures made of exceptionally strong materials might withstand the shockwaves. Additionally, those with the ability to control or counteract the shockwaves can mitigate the effects, such as stopping a tsunami created by the user. However, it’s only when the user unleashes their full rage and intent to annihilate that the true extent of the fruit’s power is revealed. Despite this, neither user nor potential successor has succeeded in completely sinking an island, though the resulting aftershocks and tsunamis have been felt far away.</div>
				<br>
				<div>When someone new acquires the power of this Devil Fruit, they may claim that the ability to create quakes, which brings widespread destruction, combined with other powerful abilities, renders them invincible and the strongest being.</div>
				<br>
				<div>However, the powers of this Devil Fruit are hazardous to both allies and enemies alike. This is due to the fact that, even though the user seems capable of controlling both the magnitude of the shockwave and its point of impact, the quakes produced are indiscriminate in their effects. Therefore, allies must be prepared to withstand the impacts to avoid becoming unintended victims.</div>
				<br>
				<div>This Devil Fruit also allows its user to forcibly take hold of any medium, enabling them to "crack" or "pull" on normally intangible objects, such as the air itself.</div>
				<br>
				<div>The Gura Gura no Mi has no apparent weaknesses aside from the standard vulnerabilities associated with Paramecia-type Devil Fruits. However, it is possible for powerful individuals to combine their abilities to counteract the shockwaves, preventing them from hitting specific targets. Additionally, defenses made of special materials might be resistant to the shockwaves. The indiscriminate nature of the user's attacks requires their allies to keep a safe distance during combat, providing enemies with wider angles to attack from.</div>
