				<div>The <strong>Uta Uta no Mi</strong> is a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows the user to teleport people's consciousnesses into a virtual space by singing.</div>

				<h1 id="Physical Details">[ Etymology ]</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>Uta (歌) is the Japanese word for "song".</li>

				<h1 id="Relationships">[ Strengths and Weaknesses ]</h1>
				<div>The weakness of the ability is that Uta World can only be maintained as long as the user remains awake. It also consumes a lot of stamina to maintain the ability for long periods of time. Potential targets can also protect themselves from the user's power by blocking their hearing from the user's music. This even applies in the Virtual World, where a target can either hide in soundproof areas or contain the user in a soundproof containment-like field. They also can not manipulate the will of others, though they can alter their spirit bodies. This applies to objects as well. Other than that, the user is affected by the standard Devil Fruit weaknesses.</div>
