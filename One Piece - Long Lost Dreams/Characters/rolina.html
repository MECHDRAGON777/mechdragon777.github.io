		<h2 id="History">History</h2>
		<hr style="margin-right:15px">
		<div class="indent">
			<div style="text-indent: 18px;"><strong>Age 2:</strong> When Rolina was a young lass, she stumbled upon the Weatherian‚Äôs Balloon Ship and was not found til a day after Weatheria had long passed where Zou was. With little control over the direction and speed of where the Sky Island of Weatheria would travel due to the winds of the world, the Weatherians would take the young Mink in. The young Rolina would like the home she would be given in the sky, though every once in a while loaned for her normal island‚Äôs nature a tad bit which formed her refusal to abandon the speech-patterns associated with her tribe. She would still be too young to remember her actual parents from Zou.</div>
			<div style="text-indent: 18px;"><strong>Age 4:</strong> After living in the White Sea for a couple of years, she would soon become interested in what the Weatherians did and learned that the weather that she only experienced a little bit over her two years of living prior was due to what the Weatherians do every so often. This would also be around the point she started to understand that she had Electro in the first place due to being a Mink.</div>
			<div style="text-indent: 18px;">The Weatherians ended up teaching her quite a bit of the technological advancements of the Weatherians as well as other stuff that any young kid would need to know. She would end up being taught how to hold writing apparatus, but never how to read proper words. In the grand scheme of things, she ended up developing her own writing system unique to her that she could read as she got older.</div>
			<div style="text-indent: 18px;"><strong>Age 5:</strong> Around her sixth birthday, Rolina would find herself outside one of the buildings after the moon rose before accidently awakening her Sulong form for the first time. She would end up rampaging for a little bit before passing out in a an area that moonlight would not reach. From then after, Rolina was taught of reasons to avoid being in Moonlight for the time being.</div>
			<div style="text-indent: 18px;"><strong>Age 6:</strong> When Rolina hit the six year mark on her life-span, she would start to develop her Electro a bit and one of the Weatherians would then toss her a Staff to train her in self-defense for when she would eventually need to leave Weatheria when she was old enough. He would note that her strikes would be electrifying and would note that she might be interested in learning that there is a special type of fruit in the world that grants people strange and mystical abilities at the cost of their ability to swim. After the time sparing, she was capable of holding off a standard nuciase trying to pick on her if she ever had to, but would hopefully never need to.</div>
			<div style="text-indent: 18px;"><strong>Age 7:</strong> When Rolina turned seven, she seemed to be more hesitant in her will to attack the Weatherian that would spar with her ever so often to train her. While she trained to keep herself safe, she started to want to focus more so on what her opponent‚Äôs would start to do before reacting with her own defensive parrys.</div>
			<div style="text-indent: 18px;">When she was finished with as much training the Weatherians could give her in sparring, they would notice that not once that the Mink picked up that the weapon they gave her to spar with was not a typical Bo-Staff, but instead a Climatact, despite being told of it‚Äôs potential. They hoped that one day, she would finally learn how to use the Climatact with the remaining knowledge they would have been passing down over the years.</div>
			<div style="text-indent: 18px;"><strong>Age 10:</strong> Rolina would eventual lose the Climatact she was given when wshe was ten and as a result, she would end up needing to get a Metal Staff instead. She would not be hindered much by the differnt shape as she had yet to learn how to use the Climatact she lost in the first place.</div>
			<div style="text-indent: 18px;"><strong>Age 12:</strong> Rolina would have started to pick up some of her trade-mark attire when she turned 12 in key to her electro. She would have a cape fashioned out of a copper color in hopes that she could one day use her ‚Äúnatural gift‚Äù as she thought of it to better redirect attacks from her blind spot; however, she would never really understood that it would never work. She kept it for the most part due to thinking it would look cool. She would also start fantasizing over a few Devil Fruits based on what she heard from the Weatherians over the years. More specifically the fruits that were more weather oriented such as the Rumble Rumble fruit, Snow Snow fruit, and Gas Gas fruit being the three fruits she often fantasizes the most about. Seeing that her Electro practically is what she was told of the Rumble Rumble fruit, she typically thinks about it less and less. She often thinks that a weather based Devil Fruit would honor what she had been taught and has enjoyed topically since she was a young lass. Her Mink-blood often makes her suffer from the heat when Weatheria passes the hotter parts of the world which makes her long for the Snow Snow fruit specifically. Rolina also starts chronicling her life from this point in her free time when she has any.</div>
			<div style="text-indent: 18px;"><strong>Age 14:</strong> Rolina would begin being taught how to read the weather in areas around where she is which greatly delights her. The lessons also give her the bright idea of embedding a barometer into some insulated gloves to read the atmospheric pressure of the area she is in and also is taught how to read it and what it means; however, due to her lack of field-training, she was never able to understand the importance of the barometer she had almost destroyed in trying to embed it into her right glove. Rolina however would write down what the Weatherians taught her about weather reading and so on in her note book.</div>
			<div style="text-indent: 18px;"><strong>Age 18:</strong> When Rolina turned 18, Weatheria would have passed over Flevance where she would be taken with the group to be dropped off with her Climatact and weather equipment due to being of age. She would continue to long for her homeland of Zou, but would note that once she got to Flevance, she would be comfortable due to her Mink-blood resonating with the colder air better than a few places Weatheria passed by. She would set-up shop as a local meteorologist, but at her current skill level, she would only be able to provide info on the current weather instead of how the weather will play out in the future. She would occasionally use her free time for sparing in her home in Flevance.</div>
			<div style="text-indent: 18px;"><strong>Age 23:</strong> One day while Rolina was doing her ussual work in Flevance in the North Blue, she would notice the Hero of Harpies and Doctor of the Revolutionary Army vist which was a shock for her. What was further a miricle in her eyes was this was the girl who held the Devil Fruit she has been after for practicaly half of her life as of yet. While It was never clear to the public, the girl was nearing the age of 800 and Rolina had no ill intent, she would sneak up to devour the harpy that used to live on her home island cenuries ago alive. As she did not have any proof of what she did, she would not be able to claim the ùï≠2'459'670'000 bounty. All she had was the Plaugedoctor's mask that was often refered to as the "Mask of the Demonness" that she wore as well as her cloak. Afterward, she would eventually flee the town in the cover of the night by sneaking aboard a vessal that was headed to the East Blue.</div>
