			<div style="font-size: 24px"><strong>Base Abilities</strong></div>
			<div style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 18px">Lunarians have the ability to emit fire from their bodies that they can control and weaponize in combat: allowing them to unleash powerful fire blasts or gatlings, clad their limbs and weapons in fire to empower their melee attacks, and even shape their flames into constructs, including very large ones. It furthermore seems that a lunarian can release their fire from their entire body in all directions, unleashing a massive explosion. At their strongest, a Lunarian's flames can be so potent that they appear to take on the consistency of magma. However, it is unknown if a lunarian's excessive use of their flames causes them any kind of drawback.</div>
			<div style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 18px">Other than that, lunarians are noted for their superhuman vitality and resilience, something that supposedly contributed to them being called "gods" before nearly going extinct. Lunarians have been shown the ability to withstand multiple extremely powerful attacks in succession without shedding a single drop of blood. More than that, lunarians either lose, after some time, or can deliberately turn off the flames burning at their back, which will cause them to temporarily lose said characteristic endurance, although this loss comes in exchange for a drastic boost in mobility, allowing members of this tribe to reach speeds faster than the untrained eye can follow.</div>
			<div style="font-size: 24px"><strong>ᛚᚢᚾᚨᚱᛟᚨᚾ ᛊᛁᛜᛖᚱ</strong></div>
			<div style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 18px">ᛚᚢᚾᚨᚱᛟᚨᚾ ᛊᛁᛜᛖᚱ known more simply as "Lunarian Singer" is a limited form of the Lunarian's Ignition racial ability tied to the voice of the user as a metric of control. It makes use of the Lunarian ᛇᛊᛏᛖᛚᛚᚨ ᛞ. ᛚᚨᛗᛒᛞᚨᛞᛖᛚᛏᚨ known more simply as just "Æstella" singing tallents as a control mechanism for the invincible flame. Depending on the type of song the user sings, the type of flame and the formation of the flames that emit from the user's mouth differ. The flames produced from a musical Lunarian tend to be more note-shaped and the stronger the user is as well as skilled in singing, the more complex note-structure they can conjure from their voice.</div>

			<div style="font-size: 24px"><strong>Known Techniques:</strong></div>
				<div style="display:none;" id="SingerC">
				<ul>
					<li><strong>ᛒᚨᛚᛚᚨᛞ ᛟᚠ ᚦᛖ ᚠᛚᚨᛗᛖ:</strong> The most basic form of the Singer varriation of Ignition that requires the user to so hit up to six notes in a song that will appear as if she was breathing fire-balls in the shape of music notes.. This type of assault is generaly triggered from ᛇᛊᛏᛖᛚᛚᚨ's "Ballad of the Flame" song.</li>
					<li><strong>ᚠᛚᚨᛗᛖ ᛒᛖᚱᚲᛖᚢᛊᛖ:</strong> A more advanced technique that has ᛇᛊᛏᛖᛚᛚᚨ bounce her voice off of a wall or another solid object before producing a flaming note. ᛇᛊᛏᛖᛚᛚᚨ ussualy sings a lullaby by the name of "Flame Verceuse" while using this ability. Her most basic form of this move comes from bouncing her voice off of air molecules to rain six musicly shaped fireballs from the sky onto a target.</li>
					<li><strong>ᛞᛖᚠᛖᚾᛊᛖ ᚲᚨᛞᛖᚾᚲᛖ:</strong> By keeping a steady cadence in her song, ᛇᛊᛏᛖᛚᛚᚨ can keep a rhyhmic sheild of fire from her mouth.</li>
					<li><strong>ᚠᛚᚨᛗᛖ ᛞᛁᛊᛊᛟᚾᚨᚾᚲᛖ:</strong> By singing at a dissonance or by just singing with anger, ᛇᛊᛏᛖᛚᛚᚨ essentialy creates a more dragonic Flame Breath. The attack is not associated with any specific song and is just known as "Flame Dissonance" by those watching.</div>
