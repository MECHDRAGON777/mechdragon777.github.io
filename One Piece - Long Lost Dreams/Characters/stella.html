		<h2 id="History">History</h2>
		<hr style="margin-right:15px">
		<div class="indent">
			<div id="Past" style="font-size: 24px"><strong>Past</strong></div>
			<div style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 18px">Æstella was born to the Harpy known as "Xæra Dhyleo Lambdadelta", the Commander of the Grand Division of the Revolutionary Army. Like her mother before her; she also shortens her own Middle name down to the "D." moniker hated around the world by most people. Æstella was originally born as a half-harpy, half-lunarian hybrid, but after her mother almost eradicated the Harpy Pirates that was started by her thirty-fifth great-granddaughter's Captain and Queen, Xæra personally went out of the way that Æstella's father's Lunarian DNA would show over her own Harpy DNA. As a result of the surgery that left Æstella a miracle in her own right; she has left nothing of her mother's relationship except for her left eye's reddish hue, last name, and being a part of the Revolutionary Army. The resulting surgery caused Æstella resentment towards Xæra for seeking out a cure for her and instead of seeking her mother's weathermancy skill out; she gravitated towards her father's pyrokinetic abilities despite being scared of fire herself. Æstella wanted to learn in great detail about her father's intense strength and durability associated with the Lunarian flame after how Xæra treated her. By the time Æstella turned seven years old, the Revolutionary Army would have been really up in motion with their plans, but as time went on, she was never allowed to join the army due to her young age at the time. Due to the sorrow caused by her own family denying her entry into the army, she would seek out another solution to aid in the Revolutionary Army's cause, even if they would deem it fruitless.</div>
			<div style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 18px">Æstella would get better at her singing as time went on and would eventually hold concerts of her own. Due to her singing voice occasionally producing a flame-breath by accident, her family eventually got her a special pair of headphones made out of seaprism stone that would nullify a future devil fruit she may acquire in the future, but also to restrain her Lunarian fire without her will so she would not burn those around her by accident. As time passed, she would eventually become more intune with herself as well as the rest of the Revolutionary Army that her parents were the leaders of. Æstella would often times sing for the Revolutionaries on Momoiro Island after any losses they would ensue from the World Government or their raids of freedom on neighboring islands. The songstress would not be the best idol around, but she would be well enough to keep the mood of those around her in good spirits with her invigorating songs. As she got older, she would eventually join the North Division of the Revolutionary Army properly, albeit against her parent's wishes who were at the head of the Revolutionary Army.</div>
			<div style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 18px">After joining the Revolutionary Army proper, Æstella has been granted more freedom than before she joined since her parent's could not risk her actually leaking data and intel if she was ever captured or got off the island. With given as much freedom as a new recruit to the Revolutionaries, she would actually be happy and would wonder if this is the feeling her songs gave to others around her. With time advancing forward in full suit, Æstella would learn how to suppress her emotions while not singing one of her songs in order to keep intel from leaking when she is in danger. From then on, she typically spent her time sparing with her father for a deeper understanding of her Lunarian DNA and what it means for her to better help her familiar ties to the Revolutionary Army while not writing new songs or singing for others. She would have yet to go on a proper mission yet and is looking forward to helping the people of Alabasta with her music.</div>
			<div id="Alabasta1" style="font-size: 24px"><strong>Alabasta</strong></div>
			<div style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 18px">Æstella would have single-handedly be sent to the desert island of Alabasta to stop a ploy to stop the assassination of the ruler. She would end up meeting a group of pirates lead by a harpy and during a concert she held to try to act as a diversion, she would end-up being accused for the attempted assassination of the ruler of Alabasta and locked in their prison for quite a while. She would end up having to be saved by the group of pirates in order to even leave the country long after the conflict that was dwelling on the island was settled missing out on any way to proove her worth and effectively failing her mission to protect the king of Alabasta.</div>
			<div id="Weatheria1" style="font-size: 24px"><strong>Weatheria</strong></div>
			<div style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 18px">After she failed to protect the people of Alabasta in a musical ploy for freedom, her family kicked her out of the Revolutionary Army for failing her mission until she could proove herself worthy of joining back with the Revolutionaries. As a result of the expulsion from the Army, Xæra flew her back to her home island of Weatheria in hopes that Æstella would learn how to both control her impulsive pyrokinetic abilities and how to speak in the common tongue on instinct instead of the runic language she gravitates towards. While back in Weatheria, Æstella would end up finding old newspapers about her niece's involvements in a pirate crew ran by some queen named "Xelyth Hynialle Arya Lyvaeno" and as a result, would learn more and more why her mother did what she did.</div>
			<div style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 18px">While Æstella hated Xæra's guts, she would understand her side more and more after reading the old news-papers. She would end up screaming at the top of her lungs which would accidently cause her flame-breath to ignite again showing how little her father's training actually helped her while she was younger. It would be obvious that the poor girl who wanted to sing about freedom of all races would be appalled by the notion that her racial lineage would have been stripped from her due to the race being seen as a nuisance to all. She would grow furious to the point of wanting to escape the island in the sky herself to proove her mother wrong about her Harpy DNA being a viral curse that needs to be eradicated.</div>
			<div style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 18px">Æstella would not spend even a week on Weatheria before learning of it being a moving island in the sky and would plan to jump off the side of the island while it was over the ocean near an island. She would try to sneak into the science division's lab on multiple occasions to try to deduce when she would need to jump to land in the waters below without the need to swim towards the island.By the time Æstella would jump off the island of Weatheria, she would miss-time her jump by a few seconds.</div>
			<div id="Gecko"style="font-size: 24px"><strong>Gecko</strong></div>
			<div style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 18px">While she fell from the White-White sea, she would notice her timing would be fatal if it was not for her Lunarian blood keeping her safe as she would have timed her jump so poorly that her decent would lead her straight for the center of the island that was not that big in the grand scheme of things. During her fall, she would be wise enough to place her inhibitor made of seaprism stone into the pocket of her coat so she could survive the impact that she would inevitably make towards the island that she actually felt sorry for. Her Lunarian wings would not quite be capable of flight quite yet, would lead to her inevitable connection to Denerick McQueen as the poor girl would barly miss him as she made inpact in Syrup Village.</div>
			<div style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 18px">After being rescued by the gentelman, she would take a while to wake up from her comma to the eyes of her savior that would be holding a guitar as she awoken. Seeing the guitar in his hands, she would feel a little more at home than she did originaly, but would not be quick to talk at first. She would notice her headset that she often wore would be on a dresser across the room and her Flameproof coat would be hung up on the wall away from her. She would be wrapped in numerous bandages from chest to her knees. She would be astonished that besides her being uncouncious for who knows how long, that she would have been completely fine without any outside visible injuries; so why would these random people care so much about her after appearing out of nowhere? She would remain mute after seeing her headset on the table and did not want to have to explain that her words are flmaable without the inhibitor. She would request that Denerick hand her the headset without speaking which would take a bit considering that she had to be either mute or burn the building down.</div>
			<div style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 18px">At this point, Æstella's only control point for her fire was the way she acented her voice thus making any word she speaks or sings create fire from the sound of her voice. She struggled with a lot of things and having her Idol carrer be the anchor to her ignition has both positives and negatives to it. For one, she can pour more time into her songs to increase the control over her own flames at the downside of having to wear her special headset just to speak. She would mostly converse in a runic language rather than the common tounge and would struggle to speak the common tongue due to her songs. After eventually convincing him to hand her the headset, she would begin to plan a concert with him.</div>
			<div style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 18px">She would have noted the shape of the island while she was falling and that it had two beaches on opposite sides of the island. She would not know that there was a north beach and a south beach, just that there was two beaches. She would discuss building a stage on the beach when she was feeling better from her fall. The beach would be a perfect place to radiate music throughout the entire island and begin making a name for herself down in the blues. She would spend the coming time until she could build the stage the songs she would be singing and would even add one to her own roaster of songs that Denerick sung to her. She struggled to keep up in learning the song that he taught her and not learn the lyrics correctly.</div>
			<div style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 18px">By the time her recovery was completed, she would make sure the stage took priority as she wanted to have it completed by nightfall. She would make sure to use free lumber from around the beaches to make a make-shift stage; however, Æstella was no builder by any merit of the word. The stage would be shotty at best and if it survives any of her flames, it would be a miracle by it's own right. By the time night fell, she would be on stage alone before her concert started proper with not a single person making their way to the beach before the first song started.</div>

			<div style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 18px">Æstella and eventualy a drunk Denerick would sing a multitude of songs while Dorei and Shankia fought off in the distance. Quite the slew of people would come by to listen to the music that was mostly Æstella's singing after Denerick fell asleep. The duo sung a plethroa of songs and Æstella even sung her fair share before Denerick passed out and Shankia eventually was drawn out by Æstella's singing. The man spoke with Indra about trying to date Æstella by bribeing her with an alcholic beverage. Shortly after, the Dryad Dorei jumped on the stage jolting Æstella into the air and knocking her headset off her head. As a result of the inhibitor's removal from her head, her lullaby that she was activly singing would turn fiery and would end up roasting the stage in the process. At the same time, Dorei would catch the falling girl out of the sky where he would proceed to try to recruit her while scaring her at the same time.</div>
			<div style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 18px">One of Dorei's crewmates named Raika would walk towards the stage and jump ontop of it to see what Dorei was upto. She would be curious to see if the potential recruit was the young Shankia that was trying to hit on Æstella or the Lunarian Æstella. After learning of the situation, Æstella would sing a song of melancholy and sorrow before expressing that she has a bad fear of fire. After one final song, she asks Dorei and Raika if she could defend herself against Shankia from hitting on her. It would bring back weird feelings to one pirate doing the same thing half-sucessfuly back in Alabasta and she would want to take out her anger from back then on Shankia for doing the samething.</div>
