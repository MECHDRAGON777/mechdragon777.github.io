				<td>While the level is not that bad, it does not give powerups as frequently as needed and when it does; it is to over compensate for when the difficulty goes haywire. (Such as with the sniffits in the final section.) The level asks a bit much for the average player to go through under normal powerup distanceing; yet, when you look at how it is here, it is kind of over the top with how little time you get to keep your powerups if you are not good at dodgeing while collecting your ice flowers. It was a unique take on how to use sniffits, I will give it that, but it also felt more spammy than not.</td>

				<td>While this level is insanely creative and I adore the effort put into this; I have a LOT of issues with this. For starters, the balloons are hard to distinguish what is inside the rubbery menace. I liked how you used the Foos to compliment the wind pushing the balloons; however, my praise ends there. The level is very janky as you often fall off of the chains on the ballons, and although the lineguide in the form of wind is clever and unique, it makes it hard to tell the path. You can also get launched at unpredictable speeds which is amplified greatly in the final section due to the amount of control I seem to lose here. Another concept of unfairness would be the blimp-like balloon in the vertical section. Its introduction is not very practical, and it just flung me off to the bottomless pit to the left when I jumped on it. Essentially it's a beginner's trap. Next time, make sure that you introduce something like that in a safe environment, and then make the obstacle layout progressively harder in a reasonable way.</td>

				<td>At first, I thought this would be a same-old-same-old 1-1 recreation, but boy was I wrong. I enjoyed playing through this level, and it is a shame it was unfinished. For the content you did finish, it was nice and relaxing. I do find it odd that you insta-warps to connect the sections. While this can work, it doesn't work well in this case because most of the time, there is no clear indication of where to go. One example would be the pyramid. The pyramid at first glance doesn't look like a pyramid, but looks like a pile of sand or a hill. There is an indentation on the hillside, and that can be an indicator of an entrance if the player is smart enough to figure it out, but it's still very ambiguous. There are a lot of offenders in this level like this, and some of them don't even have any indication. I recommend using doors or pipes in your level to make this a bit more obvious since it isn't anything puzzle related. Another quarrel I have with this level is the difficulty curve being all over the place. The level doesn't really have a focus, and the difficulty goes from flat ground to precision platforming almost instantly in between sections, then calms down later on. Basically, the level doesn't know what it wants to do. Overall, you had a unique idea, but it could have definitely been executed better. Hopefully this will help you grow as a level designer in the future.</td>

				<td>Softlock alert in the first section. These platforms are clever, and are taken form Celeste, though why can you trigger them from below? Why do they not respawn (the cause of the softlock.) I got the checkpoint reference in the final section; though the section before it is unplayable (under normal circumstances) due to a lua crash with base-game code. Not much going on other than that.</td>

				<td>Okay, this level looks and plays nicely, but man was that secret exit was cryptic. The secret exit requires you to fall down a random hole near the 2/3rds mark. The plants also have no real marking from standard plants and venus fire traps. This level does not have much going for it other than watching NPCs fall though the ground was funny. I have no clue what the toad next to the rainbow shell said for instance because of that.</td>

				<td>Hello Darkness, my old friend. This level was nice and I enjoyed every second of it (except for the light lag.) I started messing around after beating it as well and found how the mask worked to be nice. Would love to know how you made the new mount. The fact thwomps do not trigger is also rather cool. Wish the level expanded on itself a tad bit more with racing through the levle without a mask as that was a nice turn around.</td>

I am not a fan of the Kaizo Trap at the end of the level, even if it was for a joke. The resprites to standard enemies was a neat touch as well.</td>

				<td>Oh man is this a messed up level. There is this random Koopa that does not speak English and there is this Goomba who acts like a thromwp. <i>Shivers</i>. Anyway, the main idea behind this level is that you have a grappleing hook. (A Broken one might I add.) The thing detatches it self the moment you press a <b>NEW</b> key after it hits a wall which leads some interesting ideas that I do not believe to be intentional. For instance, the very first real obstacle in the level requires you to use the Grappleing hook to get up a shaft that gets wider as you go down. This alone is the hardest thing in the entire level only due to how Janky the grappleing hook is. I only got past it with abuseing that little tid-bit about how it works. (Basicaly, I jumped slightly away from the wall, faced the wall, Grappled to it, and held left like my life depended on it while before and after the hook hit the wall.) Long story short, it looks super weird having Mario walk in mid-air. Also, what is with those dancing Bannanas that keep saying "Brazille"? That was pure torture every time I fialed the first area only because of the Janky hook. It is not bad you included it, it is just that you force the player to sit through it for no real reason every time they die in the level. Other than that, it just felt like a Romp the entire time.</td>

				<td>Okay, this level is laggy for me, but it was fun for the most part. The use of the Math Platforms were phenominal to me and I am glad they work on 1F0 now. I do have to point out something and that is that the level does start to overstay it's welcome since checkpoints 1 and 2 feel the same in terms of gameplay with out adding to much variety to the level. I did love how the starcoins were used though. since the third star coin is more puzzle based (even though the puzzle can be cheesed with a quick enough reaction.) All in all, this level was mostly fun.</td>

				<td>This level was an interesting one and honestly, this is the most fun level in the entire contest so far. I was actually disappointed after not being able to dodge those fuzzies in the second star coin room just due to the fact they were fun to dodge. (I am aware it is good design practice to make them disappear after the minigame is over.) My main concerns with this level is with the Hammer Brothers as they were not used as much. (Only twice) It feels like they were used as a secondary obstacle which was a shame. Got me thinking of Hammer Brothers throwing fuzzies (which would have been cool; although, messy.) I personaly cannot find anything else wrong with this level (Other than the two blocks in the top left after hitting the final "Off" block.)</td>

				<td>This is a pretty crazy level and I like that you are fair with checkpoints. It can be a bit tedious at first, but once you get the hang of a setup in the level, you will ussualy not have that much of a hassle with the level itself. The main problem is that there are a lot of death-traps (softlocks if there was no way to die in the area) in the level. The level could benefit from a bit less slime and a bit more solid ground in some places and/or have a way to get out of a death-trap situation since most of those are caused by missing a jump and landing on the wrong side of a Snailcorn. Otherwise, it is a fine level.</td>

				<td>This is a pretty soild level without many flaws if any at all. Just a generic grassland like those you would find in Mario World. The main concern here is that it does not seem to bolster any creativity of it's own; but it does seem to pull quite well in what it trys to accomplish. I should point one thing out and that is that you should never put a horizontal pipe-wrap in the center of the pipe, but at the bottom of the pipe instead.</td>

				<td>Well, this needs some work Todd, but at least you gave it a shot. The two starcoins in the level were interesting, even though there is a begginner's trap with the second one. On another note, you have Grrrol Generators comeing from thin air; ussualy, you put generators on pipes. On another note, one of the setups used seems a bit sketchy for the average player where you need to spinjump over a Grrrol comeing out of thin air at the screen's edge on a slope.</td>

				<td>Functionality 10</td>
				<td>Well, this is a weird little city scape where the locals teach you how to NOT play Baseball. I found some of the setups hillariously funny though such as how Bowser was used. My main concern comes from three areas. First off, the Baseballs in the air on the green mushroom is a tad tight, but it would have actually been an interesting set-up if it was not so tight. The second place of concern is the → Jump Barrel between two baseball launchers. (80% of the time, it did not fling me far enough. The other issue is the main one and that is the boss. It is very easy to cheese the first four hits; but after the fifth and sixth hits, it gets ludacriously hard. The main issue is not even dodging the baseballs on the wings, but the fact that the boom-boom is faster than any NPC should ever be in SMBX. I lost count of how many times I got hit by the Boom-Boom just because of his sheer speed. I got to the point where I had to make sure I oly hit him at the edges of the arena and stand at the opposite side to cheese the first four hits. (For the record, this boom-boom attacks when in it's shell, so the first hit you do triggers his first attack. There are three attacks that are each done twice before advancing meaning you need to attack the boom-boom <b><i>SEVEN</i></b> times which is WAY too much.) Adding a "Boss Health Bar" to this boss would make this feel a tad bit more at home consdiering it's seven hits and all. When it comes to the music, you choice nice music, but JENOVA's boss theme does NOT fit this Demonic Boom-Boom angle you made.</td>

				<td>Okay, this level was phenominal and I loved the water jets and bubbles. The Water Jet's did not have a good sprite though as they looked like fire. I was at first scared I would get hit; I saw no other way to advance, so I tried to spinjump on them. Yeah, it is taught in a good way with a safty net; it did however take you out of the flow of the level. The second starcoin is a bit cryptic though. I love the third star coin til I realized the item choice you get is meaningless. (You can reenter the pipe.) I do wish you combined the gimmicks more than you did though. The ending was super nice though.</td>

				<td>This is a pretty swell level, though the wall jump and the ground-pound do not seem like good additions to this level. Also, considering the current bug with Mutant vines, I do not know if you legit made mistakes and forgot to place things, or if this was made in a differnt version or what, but block cutoff was a result of it before the checkpoint. The second Dragon/Star coin is a bit Janky as well as you do not get much space to grab it and if you fall, you instantly die due to the layer the munchers are on is moving while you take damage thus counting as crushing the player. The sound effects ruined the mood of the level though.</td>

				<td>Functionality 8.9</td>
				<td>Where do I even begin with this? This level is a monster in the abstract world and it is a massive undertaking to complete. The inspiration pouring in is blantantly obvious in all differnt forms. I can see insperation from Celeste, Megaman, and a few others. They are all blended nicely in a clever and creative way. The fact you have the Star Coins used to unlock a reward is nice; even if the reward made me cringe. The multiple colors were nice and it went from "calm" to "agressive" over time. The level is laggy to an extent. This level however does have a glaring flaw other than its length. This level takes around 30 minutes to complete when you know what you are doing and do <b>NOT</b> die. It also has a weird bug with the yellow jump-platforms. If sometimes, they randomly switch when you fall off of them (happened once) or when you bounce off of an NPC. (happened a lot in the grinder section at the end of the yellow area as well as the unfair death at the very end of the level.) I know they are supposed to trigger if bouncing off an NPC if you time your jump, but it seems odd that they sometimes do and sometimes do not. (In the same case no less.) The eye itself in the final area is also a tad difficult to dodge, but is not that bad. This level also has tons of gimmicks and ideas and it is spaced quite nicly umong themselfs and even merged into a single area all in a final culmination at the end. You even see them intertwined slowly as you advance. Also, that vertical section was a blast, but the massive amount of eyes did scare me when I first played this, but standing still is what is needed; so it is used for dramatic build up before the level turns from green to yellow. The powerups tend to be to scarce at times and to plentiful at others.</td>

				<td>Okay, this level is a mess. I liked the first part of the level, but then it lost focus. All of the Touhou references were a bit over the top. The fairies were really too much. The issues do not stop there either though, The way you mixxed the two tilesets was not executed properly. I love the Pipe-area though. The <b>first</b> boss was long and overstayed his welcome. The secret boss is a Touhou character whose sprite does <b>NOT</b> fit. <sub>(Hint, it is Satori Komeji, a Yokai girl who can read people's minds. She even tells you how many times you died and where you died most. She even compliments you with a threat if you make it to her deathless. "???: You didn't die a single time throughout the journey. I am impressed, but that doesn't mean you are to able to survive my attacks." Keep in mind that you have to beat the level and them play half of it to even get to the secret area. Dieing in this boss fight (or the Kamek boss fight for that matter), it treatas your death as the final platforming section instead (I assume this happens if your death counts are equal.)</sub> Eitherway, the bosses overstay there welcome and just look like a mess. The sillouete to the lightning was my favorite part of the entire level though. P.S. Why does Kamek throw Arrows and why do the Arrows Spin?</td>

				<td>First I want to say this level gives you a timer of 1000 seconds and second of all, I used 966 of those seconds to beat this level on my first playthrough. This level is long and plays out more like a mini-sode instead of a level. Anyway, the level starts out in a grassland, transistions to a cave and eventually to an underwater area. That water area had some percise swimming that I was not a fan of at all. The level tops everything off with a pretty tough Pirate ship segment. Overall, it is one of those levels that is a "Romp that requires playing the four main themes of <i>Super Mario Brothers 1</i> in a single level, but harder and well checkpointed. I am not a fan of the Hammer Brother Spam this level gets into though. This level also has risk versus reward a tad bit backwards. (It is sometimes more beneficial to take the less risky path for a better reward.</td>

				<td>Okay, this level is interesting and has a weird aesthetic to it being from Tiny Toons. The graphics fit with the music seeing they are from the same game; however, the player and the defualt HUD of SMBX do not. I enjoyed the secret Fire Flower and reminds me of the old school Sega and Nintendo games. (8-bit era.) It is an easy level for the most part with the exception of the boss? Elmyra is not really a boss, but the wording is a bit off. The Mouse states "If Elmyra catches you" which made me thing that she insta-kills on contact. It is <b>NOT</b> clear you are however supposed to dodge her instead of jump on her head like most bosses in SMBX. I love how she stops the moment you collect the star though. Something this level did well is that you have differnt pathes through the level like Sonic games did as well as Celeste's Chapter 6. I found it a nice nod; even if the top path was ussualy way easier to the point of being trivial.</td>

				<td>I love how this level plays and feels; it kept me on my toes the entire way though. I am not a fan of the choice in tileset for the Factory part of this level; but it fits oddly enough. I thought I would NEVER see Enjl's Electrical boxes after all these years and here, you used them quite nicely. After the halfway point (which felt more like the seventy-five percent mark,) you kind of just forgot about them it feels like in exchange for the Synched Switches. When I saw you were using them both at the same time, it brought a glint to my eye with excitement only to be disapointed that it ended before it really kicked off. If this level was a tad longer to show both of its gimmicks used in unison like how you used the grinders and the sync blocks; it might have been better. I have to ask why the checkpoint was placed where it was though since it seems so far into the level? Adding a second checkpoint would not have hurt if either.</td>

				<td>This is a level that focuses on a weird little portal NPC. What is NOT good is that this level forces you to carry a P-Switch through portals which forces you to drop the P-Switch making the third Star-Coin almost impossible. (There are two P-Switches in the level. One is Janky and the otherone requires backtracking.) I never found the second starcoin after hours of searching as well. The idea of the level is doging fire shot through portals and using them to understand the timing of a Goomba projectile generator. The ending is ingenious, but not well made. During the first fire-rain segments, you at least have a  visual que of where to stand; you do not have such a luxury at the end of the level with fire raining on pipes. At least the ending was cute.</td>

(It was not marked on the roster, so yeah.) The main level was a bit finiky with its double jump and the chase sequence at the end was harder than it needed to be. The level suffers from a lot of lag as well. The level could have been longer, but I fear that the lag might have gotten worse if it was. The music is the worst part of the level in my eyes as I see no reason you should ever have vocals in your music (Even if it is from Persona 4.) Did you know if you spam through the spoken dialog at the end, you can glitch the audio to sound like a demon? (Voiceacting in SMBX is not a good idea.) The make-shift Boohemoth was interesting, even if it does insta-kill the player.</td>

I do like a few things this level does such as the line guided paddlewheel platform under the plant pipes, but there are other areas that are just ehh to play. The fourth Star Coin is a tad cryptic on top of that. The checkpoint should honestly be closer to the half way point instead of right between the third and fourth starcoins (at the end of the level for some reason.)</td>

Not much else can be said other than neededing an auto-jump and more fleshed out controls like the original GD had. Some of the jumps are tighter than they first seem as a result.

Eitherway, the level is a tad too difficult to only have one checkpoint. The boss was a blast, even if it is a tad much. Just wish you hid the thrown bunnades and sharp carrots after beating her. I should point out that the first Starcoin is unfair if you do not kill the Bunny Bots before entering the door. As with the themeing, the Goombas, Swoopers, and Drybones do not really seem to fit. I am sure you could have found SOME bunnified version of them to keep with the rabbit theme. Liked the Rabi-Ribi tileset though.</td>

Like, the red switch and Larry Koopa are pointless as you can enter doors without ground and you never hid the end of the level. A way I would suggest to fix this is to not shrink the camera (due to the reserve box messes up as a result) and to make the tileset two instead of a cutout of one.</td>
