				<td>While the level is not that bad, it does not give powerups as frequently as needed and when it does; it is to over compensate for when the difficulty goes haywire. (Such as with the sniffits in the final section.) The level asks a bit much for the average player to go through under normal powerup distanceing; yet, when you look at how it is here, it is kind of over the top with how little time you get to keep your powerups if you are not good at dodgeing while collecting your ice flowers. It was a unique take on how to use sniffits, I will give it that, but it also felt more spammy than not.</td>

				<td>While this level is insanely creative and I adore the effort put into this; I have a LOT of issues with this. For starters, the balloons are hard to distinguish what is inside the rubbery menace. I liked how you used the Foos to compliment the concept of wind pushing the balloons however. That is where the good things end however. The level is very janky as you often fall off of the chains on the ballons and the although lineguide in the form of wind is clever and unique, it makes it hard to tell the path. You can also get launched at unpredictable speeds which is amplified in great extint in the final section due to the amount of control I seem to lose here. Anohter concept of unfairness would be the blimb-like ballon in th evertical section. It's introduction is not well thought out and when I blindly jumped on it like anyone without knowledge of how it would react would do; it just flung me off to the bottomless pit to the left. It would have been more fair to introduce the thing with some form of safty net first.</td>

				<td>At first, I thought this would be a same-old-same-old 1-1 recreation, but boy was I wrong. I enjoyed playing through this level and it is a shame it was unfinished. For the content you did finish, it was nice and relaxing. I do find it odd that you put an insta-warp at the vase connecting the fourth and fifth sections instead of a pipe warp and the way you enter the pyramid. My main quarrel with this level is the difficulty balance and the edge of the screen insta-warps. (That and the fact you can swim in waterfalls.) I have seen this concept done in the past and I do say I like this implementation of it; just wish there were pipe-warps or doors instead of insta-wraps between sections. Not much to say about the vanilla aesthetic this holds.</td>

				<td>Softlock alert in the first section. These platforms are clever, and are taken form Celeste, though why can you trigger them from below? Why do they not respawn (the cause of the softlock.) I got the checkpoint reference in the final section; though the section before it is unplayable (under normal circumstances) due to a lua crash with base-game code. Not much going on other than that.</td>

				<td>Okay, this level looks and plays nicely, but man was that secret exit was cryptic. The secret exit requires you to fall down a random hole near the 2/3rds mark. The plants also have no real marking from standard plants and venus fire traps. This level does not have much going for it other than watching NPCs fall though the ground was funny. I have no clue what the toad next to the rainbow shell said for instance because of that.</td>

				<td>Hello Darkness, my old friend. This level was nice and I enjoyed every second of it (except for the light lag.) I started messing around after beating it as well and found how the mask worked to be nice. Would love to know how you made the new mount. The fact thwomps do not trigger is also rather cool. Wish the level expanded on itself a tad bit more with racing through the levle without a mask as that was a nice turn around.</td>

				<td>This level is way to crashy due to how Snake was coded. Not much I can say other than this level just plain does not work that well.Get caught by too many NPCs at the same time and the game crashes. I also did not find it fun. At least the ideas was nice.</td>

				<td>Aesthetic Synergy 9</td>
				<td>Functionality 8</td>
				<td>I should point out that the level does look a bit meh. It plays nicly, but you have to collect all of the "Key Coins" in one live making the checkpoints practicaly useless. One of my favorite levels in the contest if it was exected a bit better. This should have used SaveData instead.</td>

				<td>I love the conveyors only if they were not as laggy as they were. Some of the setups however were very iffy such as with the sawblade area near the second mushroom in the vertical section. Probroly could have used a second checkpoint for fairness sake though.</td>

				<td>I loved the level and the Shell jump near the end is well showcased with that coin. The level progressively got harder and harder; even though it ended on such a high note (in difficulty) that it is kind of insane. I am not a fan of the Kaizo Trap at the end of the level, even if it was for a joke. The resprites to standard enemies was a neat touch as well.</td>
