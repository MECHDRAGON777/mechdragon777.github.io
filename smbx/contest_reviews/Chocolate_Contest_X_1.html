				<td>While the level is not that bad, it does not give powerups as frequently as needed and when it does; it is to over compensate for when the difficulty goes haywire. (Such as with the sniffits in the final section.) The level asks a bit much for the average player to go through under normal powerup distanceing; yet, when you look at how it is here, it is kind of over the top with how little time you get to keep your powerups if you are not good at dodgeing while collecting your ice flowers. It was a unique take on how to use sniffits, I will give it that, but it also felt more spammy than not.</td>

				<td>While this level is insanely creative and I adore the effort put into this; I have a LOT of issues with this. For starters, the balloons are hard to distinguish what is inside the rubbery menace. I liked how you used the Foos to compliment the wind pushing the balloons; however, my praise ends there. The level is very janky as you often fall off of the chains on the ballons, and although the lineguide in the form of wind is clever and unique, it makes it hard to tell the path. You can also get launched at unpredictable speeds which is amplified greatly in the final section due to the amount of control I seem to lose here. Another concept of unfairness would be the blimp-like balloon in the vertical section. Its introduction is not very practical, and it just flung me off to the bottomless pit to the left when I jumped on it. Essentially it's a beginner's trap. Next time, make sure that you introduce something like that in a safe environment, and then make the obstacle layout progressively harder in a reasonable way.</td>

				<td>At first, I thought this would be a same-old-same-old 1-1 recreation, but boy was I wrong. I enjoyed playing through this level, and it is a shame it was unfinished. For the content you did finish, it was nice and relaxing. I do find it odd that you insta-warps to connect the sections. While this can work, it doesn't work well in this case because most of the time, there is no clear indication of where to go. One example would be the pyramid. The pyramid at first glance doesn't look like a pyramid, but looks like a pile of sand or a hill. There is an indentation on the hillside, and that can be an indicator of an entrance if the player is smart enough to figure it out, but it's still very ambiguous. There are a lot of offenders in this level like this, and some of them don't even have any indication. I recommend using doors or pipes in your level to make this a bit more obvious since it isn't anything puzzle related. Another quarrel I have with this level is the difficulty curve being all over the place. The level doesn't really have a focus, and the difficulty goes from flat ground to precision platforming almost instantly in between sections, then calms down later on. Basically, the level doesn't know what it wants to do. Overall, you had a unique idea, but it could have definitely been executed better. Hopefully this will help you grow as a level designer in the future.</td>

				<td>Softlock alert in the first section. These platforms are clever, and are taken form Celeste, though why can you trigger them from below? Why do they not respawn (the cause of the softlock.) I got the checkpoint reference in the final section; though the section before it is unplayable (under normal circumstances) due to a lua crash with base-game code. Not much going on other than that.</td>

				<td>Okay, this level looks and plays nicely, but man was that secret exit was cryptic. The secret exit requires you to fall down a random hole near the 2/3rds mark. The plants also have no real marking from standard plants and venus fire traps. This level does not have much going for it other than watching NPCs fall though the ground was funny. I have no clue what the toad next to the rainbow shell said for instance because of that.</td>

				<td>Hello Darkness, my old friend. This level was nice and I enjoyed every second of it (except for the light lag.) I started messing around after beating it as well and found how the mask worked to be nice. Would love to know how you made the new mount. The fact thwomps do not trigger is also rather cool. Wish the level expanded on itself a tad bit more with racing through the levle without a mask as that was a nice turn around.</td>

				<td>This level is way to crashy due to how Snake was coded. Not much I can say other than this level just plain does not work that well.Get caught by too many NPCs at the same time and the game crashes. I also did not find it fun. At least the ideas was nice.</td>

				<td>I should point out that the level does look a bit meh. It plays nicly, but you have to collect all of the "Key Coins" in one live making the checkpoints practicaly useless. One of my favorite levels in the contest if it was exected a bit better. This should have used SaveData instead.</td>

				<td>I love the conveyors only if they were not as laggy as they were. Some of the setups however were very iffy such as with the sawblade area near the second mushroom in the vertical section. Probroly could have used a second checkpoint for fairness sake though.</td>

				<td>I loved the level and the Shell jump near the end is well showcased with that coin. The level progressively got harder and harder; even though it ended on such a high note (in difficulty) that it is kind of insane. I am not a fan of the Kaizo Trap at the end of the level, even if it was for a joke. The resprites to standard enemies was a neat touch as well.</td>

				<td>Okay, this level was phenominal and I loved the water jets and bubbles. The Water Jet's did not have a good sprite though as they looked like fire. I was at first scared I would get hit; I saw no other way to advance, so I tried to spinjump on them. Yeah, it is taught in a good way with a safty net; it did however take you out of the flow of the level. The second starcoin is a bit cryptic though. I love the third star coin til I realized the item choice you get is meaningless. (You can reenter the pipe.) I do wish you combined the gimmicks more than you did though. The ending was super nice though.</td>

				<td>Creative Implementation 30</td>
				<td>Aesthetic Synergy 14.5</td>
				<td>Functionality 10</td>
				<td>This level was an interesting one and honestly, this is the most fun level in the entire contest so far. I was actually disappointed after not being able to dodge those fuzzies in the second star coin room just due to the fact they were fun to dodge. (I am aware it is good design practice to make them disappear after the minigame is over.) My main concerns with this level is with the Hammer Brothers as they were not used as much. (Only twice) It feels like they were used as a secondary obstacle which was a shame. Got me thinking of Hammer Brothers throwing fuzzies (which would have been cool; although, messy.) I personaly cannot find anything else wrong with this level (Other than the two blocks in the top left after hitting the final "Off" block.)</td>

				<td>Where do I even begin with this? This level is a monster in the abstract world and it is a massive undertaking to complete. The inspiration pouring in is blantantly obvious in all differnt forms. I can see insperation from Celeste, Megaman, and a few others. They are all blended nicely in a clever and creative way. The fact you have the Star Coins used to unlock a reward is nice; even if the reward made me cring. The multiple colors was nice and it went from "calm" to "agressive" over time. The level is laggy to an extent. I cannot actually find any other flaws in this which is a massive shock.</td>

				<td>Structure 6</td>
				<td>Creativity 13</td>
				<td>Creative Implementation 4</td>
				<td>Aesthetic Synergy 4</td>
				<td>Functionality 8</td>
				<td>This level is a mess and viewport.lua does not help. The idea was great, but everything else just hurts so much. Like, the red switch and Larry Koopa are pointless as you can enter doors without ground and you never hid the end of the level. A way I would suggest to fix this is to not shrink the camera (due to the reserve box messes up as a result) and to make the tileset two instead of a cutout of one.</td>
